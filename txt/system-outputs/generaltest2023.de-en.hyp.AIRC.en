Diego Cocca becomes Mexico's new national coach
In the summer of 2026, Mexico, together with the United States and Canada, set up the World Cup for the first time with 48 teams. Cocca is applying for the succession of Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not extended after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. The 50-year-old did not rank among the favourites for the post until just a few days ago. He had not taken over as coach of Mexican club Tigres until November. His surprising appeal to the national coach sparked anger at the club.
Geesthacht: New beds signs are to be animated for replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) set up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The action "Geesthacht blossoms up" also includes information about what is just flourishing there - currently in the colours white and pink.
Thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought to Earth since 2015, with the help of many volunteers from associations, schools, nurseries, businesses and institutions. Target: In the Geesthacht town area, flower bulbs and plants are to emerge, where insects find food at all times. "On favourable weather conditions, the bees fly out as early as January to seek food," Friedhelm Ringe of the Geesthachter Nabu says. He himself has hives on the property.
In order not only to keep an action from nature conservationists and the city’s professional service environment, but also to draw wide circles into the private gardens, explanatory boards are always put to the plants. About 50 signs are up to now. Passers-by are supposed to be able to inform themselves in this way, which flourishes so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will replant at home.
In the first week of January was already the start of the season at the Wildhasel
Recent dates are shrubs such as winter eagle kirk and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the Kübel on the Bergedorer Straße for a year now, show the first delicate flowers in white and pink, and have recently been considered with further signs. "The Winterduftheckenkirsche is a very wide bush shrub and can grow between two metres high and three metres wide," can be read there, for example, to the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasises that it is not only the beetroot plants that show flowers. In the first week of January it was already a season start at the Wildhasel. It flourishes particularly lushly on the slopes, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Steppen keeps me young"
Munich - Dance God Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of her when he looks down from the sky to the Munich East Railway Station!
Every Monday they meet at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at point 3 p.m. three ladies to the fleeting stepp dance - together they are unbelievable 277 years old, pardon young!
The eldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the Munich native (15 January 1921) of the Schwanthaler Höh, Monday is the climax of the week.
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (nearly 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing the dance legs.
The 97-year-old is in Jena (Thüringen) in 1926. She was a soubrette, today you would say musical performer, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I spent my life with dancing, acting and singing."
At the age of 79, Elfriede Widmann is something like chicking in the round of step dancers. She says, "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl."
Wikipedia: Stepptanz was developed in the U.S. in the 19th century and is now known everywhere in the world. With two metal plates that are more durable than the initially used wood soles, front and back on the shoes, rhythmic sounds are generated when dancing, which suits the visual impression and music. The dancer is thus also the percussion musician. The English expression for this is loudly danced and the French clquette. The Spanish flamenco may have influenced the stepp dance. At the same time, the tops of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a good sound while dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at the East Railway Station. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, with us are big and small, old and young welcome."
And what's the recipe for such a long life? "I keep the exercise young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol."
Analog in Dialogue - The Limits of Digital
As digitalization progresses, the desire for analogue grows again
The Rasanz, with which our everyday life became digital, hardly left us time to set rules for dealing with it and adapting our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to have a telephone conversation in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either you were among the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you were among those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could phone for a bottle of Radeberger with the kinship. Or you were looking for a phone cell. Unforgetting the smell of the plasterer and clicking the small-money coins in the vending machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see each other's face when calling - picture telephony, I thought, what would be a great thing!
How on in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has appointed former Home Minister Dorin Recean to form the government.
The 48-year-old business expert now has 14 days to do so, so far Recean has been one of the president’s advisers.
After just a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita had surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure. As she herself announced as a statement for her demission - apparently she was fomented by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for their "enormous victims."
Moldova is neighbouring Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is above 40 percent and the small republic has picked up tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the Parliament of Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (party of action and solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, as it seats 63 of 101, and the confirmation of the new Head of State and his Cabinet is therefore unlikely to be a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the Promises
2023 will be celebrated again neatly in Veitshöchheim. The 5th season is in full swing and the prominence didn't ask for long.
His father, Markus Söder, did not go as Moses, which his costume suggests. He sees himself as the tribal elder of Bavaria. On his side wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bayern's environment and consumer protection minister, Thorsten Glauber, has opted out of the Paw Patrol's children's hero Chase for his costume.
From the depths of the sea to Franken came Minister of Justice Georg Eisenreich and Ms Anja.
Completely distinguished: Minister for Science and Art, Markus Blume, pulls it into space.
President Ilse Aigner did not seek any less than "Mama Bavaria" as a model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's health minister Klaus Holetschek alongside Gattin Birgit.
Bob the Builder alias Bauminister Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's gold boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She wore silver.
He even plays the sheriff in the carnival: Bavaria's interior minister Joachim Herrmann. On his side wife Gerswid.
On the Walz: Economy Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays tribute to the craft with his costume.
The political opposition, of course, was not allowed to be missing.
All for Bavaria: Green-Parina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-founder Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the SPD parliamentary chief Lust: Florian von Brunn with SPD leader Ronja Endres.
Royal became a member of FDP parliamentary chief Martin Hagen, and he and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
He certainly speaks more otherwise. In Veitshöchheim, the group chairman in the EU parliament, Manfred Weber, was on the road as a pantomime. On his side, Ms Andrea.
When he can't cope with politics, he can conjure Nuremberg's OB Marcus King as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermine.
Flott on the road as a beeline: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: the legal director of the BR, Eva Majuntke, BR-Intendantin Katja Wildermuth and BR culture program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side-step against the climate activists from the Franconian crime Commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
The first mayor of Veitshöchheim was of course not allowed to miss, Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn Achter in the World Cup sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now already collected 14 World Cup titles and continues to close to his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on the spot as a TV expert, is still undisputed record-breaking with 20 World Cup gold medals. Even partly strong fog prevented permanent winner Bö from collecting his second gold at the racecourse. On Wednesday, it had already topped out for the successful title defence with Norway's mixed relay.
Hardly anyone doubts that number three will follow in hunting race. In the chase, Bö is once again the clear favourite. His running form is outstanding, so he can easily offset shooting errors to a certain degree.
At Doll, however, nothing happened again. After the Routinian had given all odds of a medal to the start with a penalty round in the mixed relay and there had only been a place six, it didn't run any better three days later. Three penalty rounds already in the lying-in-state and two more standing were a huge disappointment for the elder in the German team, who had celebrated the greatest success of his career in that discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen, he surprisingly won six years ago with 0.7 seconds of precedence from Bö. It was one of a total of just three career successes by Doll, who was once on the podium so far this winter. Beijing's Olympic ace pulled wordless from it after his weak appearance and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees managed to finish 19th, second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden welcomes Lula: "must advocate for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazil counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is primarily about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
U.S. President Joe Biden bragged for the preservation of democratic values on a visit by his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We need to continue to advocate for democracy, for the democratic values that make up the core of our strength." Lula countered with a view to his right-wing incumbent Jair Bolsonaro: "Brazil has isolated for four years."
Left-wing politician Lula had prevailed at the end of October in a runoff election against Bolsonaro. On January 1, Lula took office. The change in power was accompanied by heavy wreaths. Followers of Bolsonaro had stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the government seat in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil recalls in dire fashion the storm on the U.S. Capitol a good two years ago, in which followers of then-President Donald Trump violently invaded the House in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much to international relations. "His world started and ended with Fake News, morning, afternoon and evening," Lula said. "Come to me well known," Biden replied - an obvious nod to his incumbent Trump.
Short note about the press - Friday
Do you remember the RAF flag posters?
In a country with a culture of denunciation that existed even before coronavirus, so public sentiment was made, against the most dangerous opponents of the BRD; let's say civil democracy, let's say to late-capitalist society. (Nothing to the really dangerous in needle stripe suit and tie.)
Now the Stuttgart newspaper, which is otherwise rather behind Raudis in the S-Bahns or onanists in the park, gives a reboot with the "war criminal" of Putin's friends. Because those are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because there are in this world of Asia, Africa and Latin America perhaps more "Russian friends" than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not about it, but: Ms. Wagenknecht is on place 1 to 5 (!), then Ms. Schwarzer follows.
Well, I don't know anyone in my area who reads this sheet. If so, it would be high time now. We have reached the known level, where nothing is under it anymore.
And at the latest, well dialectically, Ms. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all those who are not yet completely dissolved, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and antimilitaristic. (And there is no need for differentiation here.)
Harald Glööckler filed for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Confirmed Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser to the "pictured" newspaper and RTL in the same wording. There, he says, "I can confirm that my client has filed a request for his life partnership through his family lawyer. I do not outweigh details."
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were 35 years together, break-up rumours had existed for about a year. After his jungle camp participation, the fashion designer is said to have already moved to Berlin from the shared home in the Palatineate, according to various media reports. He also spoke on the RTL show about marriage issues.
SS massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane: Last survivor dead
A memorial center was set up in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, the ruins of which were preserved. France's President Emmanuel Macron had awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended the values of France, Macron said. He also contributed to the Franco-German peace. The survivor had advocated, among other things, for German-French youth encounters.
A curved position for 14 houses: in Homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ-series Nordlippische Weiler: In Homeien, there are not rarely three, four generations living under one roof. Here the residents find Idylle pure. In the summer, 300 motorcycles a day also brew the curvy route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some also return.
German bank chief Christian Sewing thinks further interest rate hikes are necessary in the fight against the high rate of interpreting "absolutely." "The inflationary risks are further big. The cost of energy can rise slightly again, and China's opening up can also temporarily give prices a boost," Sewing told the "world on Sunday."
The European Central Bank (ECB) had raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row in early February, and a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key rate in the euro area, meanwhile, is 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates are depleting loans, which can slow down demand and thus counteract high rates of depreciation. Higher borrowing rates can also cause investment to be deferred and thus weaken economic growth.
Even for highly indebted euro states such as Italy, rising interest rates are a strain. "The consequences of permanently high inflation are much more severe than the higher funding costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course, we need to keep that in mind, but a high level of debt must not stop the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB is aiming for price stability in the euro area in the medium term at a forecast rate of two percent. This target has been far away for months. While the price boost weakened again in January, consumer prices in the euro area, meanwhile, were 8.5 percent above the level of the previous month.
Higher inflation rates are decreasing the purchasing power of consumers, as they can afford less for a euro, and sharply increased energy prices, which are driving inflation, are also a burden for businesses.
If inflation stays high, private consumption will "break in sooner or later," warned Sewing, who is also the president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). "Therefore, I see the greatest danger to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch head Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany-Tempo" declared by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) on infrastructure projects. "There will have to be a political and societal dialogue on that. And he may as well be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a rulebook will come out, with which it may not necessarily have to go as quickly as with the LNG terminals in operation at the time of the change in the year - but also not as slow as before.
In mid-December, the first German terminal for imports of liquefied liquefied natural gas (LNG) had been opened after ten months of planning and construction time. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply a bit wide due to lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany temperature." Moreover, the federal government had recently launched an acceleration of permitting procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government is acting so quickly when it comes to it. But that should not automatically mean that from now on, we always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind wheel into the garden against its will," Hartung said. There must therefore still be a negotiation process, which we find correct and wrong as a society.
In the past, we tried and did not manage to do it with the classic rulebook. "We should think again if the previous procedure was so correct. Maybe we also exaggerated it with the rulebook and made it too complicated for us."
Given the many open tasks, such as the expansion of electricity lines, he does not regret the federal government and the companies involved, Hartung said. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as it is."
Union warns of crushing Bayer group
The chemistry union IG BCE warns of a crushing of the group after an announced head change at Bayer. "From the perspective of employees, Bayer is just right up for the challenges of the future with his three standpoints," Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and Bayer supervisory board, told the "Rhine Post" (Saturday edition).
"The transformation of the industry is only handled with a company policy based on risk sharing and sustainability - and not hedge fund activism."
Background is the head change at the pharmaceutical and agricultural chemistry group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss, Werner Baumann, will still clear the post this summer. The former pharmacy head of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is expected to take over in early June.
Baumann has long faced criticism. The 2018 takeover of U.S. seed maker Monsanto for $63 billion depends on the manager. With the purchase, Leverkusen's expensive legal battles for alleged cancer risks from weed destroyer Glyphosat had caught up in the house. The Bayer stock was in sinking for years. In 2019, shareholders even denied the discharge to the board chief at the general meeting.
For a long time, it was known that Baumann was not seeking an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. Pressure had long-term strategic investors. Lastly, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors like Bluebell Capital also mixed in. Bluebell insists on a split-up of the group, according to a media report.
The very small fund with an unknown amount of participation in Bayer is known for aggressive action. A break-up of "the Consumer Health sector would be a possible way to boost the corporate value," Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the "Rheinische Post," said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the "Rheinische Post." However, a break-up of the far larger agricultural sector Crop Science does not think it is feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
Also on Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions oppose the concentrated protest on the street, and hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform on Saturday.
In France on Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people are again expected to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, unions are mobilising against the mid-government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice, over a million people have already taken to the streets and there have been nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 attendees were counted at protests. A turbulent debate has been ongoing in parliament for a week.
Already, many people in France are already working longer than the age of 62, if they have not paid long enough for a tee-free pension with the age limit. In many exhausting professions, people could hardly work longer, the opponents of the reform think. Moreover, employees wanted to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not fully disguise their health in the job.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension fund
Macron bases the reform with a looming deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. To keep the level of pension stable, the population needed to work a little more. Critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
However, it is not only at pension age that the government wants to screw up. The aim is to speed up the necessary single-payment period for a full pension, to abolish individual pension schemes with privileges for certain professions. The minimum pension is to rise to around 1200 euros.
Pension reform is considered to be one of President Macron's most important projects. During the coronavirus pandemic, a first start to the implementation of the reform was cut off, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Even some presidents before Macron tried with varying success to reform the French pension system - broad protest and strikes were all certain.
As Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to bring through the reform with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced support. Some of the MPs, though - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even bigger than the fear of a snap vote is likely to be the concern of paralysing strikes at the moment at Macron. Ahead of the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said he could count on the organizer's sense of responsibility so that they ran quietly and did not lead to a blockade of the country.
Quiet weather expected - in high places a lot of sun
A powerful high-pressure area is over central Europe and determines the weather in Germany, does that mean that there is a lot of sunshine everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, at least until midweek high pressure weather is expected. "Looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area immediately catches eye across central Europe," explains the meteorologist Markus Übel of the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Zwar shifts a little to the east over the next week, but it continues to determine the weather in Germany."
However, quiet high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel.
On Sunday, it will start to rain in most regions. From the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Niederbayern, it can also rain a little, according to the DWD. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens in the daytime and the sun becomes increasingly apparent. In the rest of the country, it stays heavily cloudy or high-nebulae. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the gradually becoming sun rises again at the high fog and can dissolve it more and more in the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the highlands of the Central Mountains and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, it will be expected all day long, otherwise it will have to fight through the high fog ceiling. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, at the Lower Rhine are 11 degrees, in the permanent grey in the south-east are only expected by 3 degrees. To this, weak winds from different directions will blow.
On Tuesday, there may be only a tame resolution of fog or high fog in some precipitation. Otherwise, the weather will be cheerful after fog resolution. In high altitudes, in vast parts of NRW and at the edge of the Alps, forecasts suggest that the sun will shine all day. Temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominator had: again not a World Cup medal for Goggia
Beaten top-favourite Sofia Goggia has shown heavy disappointment following her exit in the downhill of the alpine ski world championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I haven't brought the performance I can," the Italian said in the ZDF after threading in at a goal and getting out. After all, the 30-year-old could still prevent a possibly severe fall.
Goggia has been the dominant runner-up in the World Cup for years. Four of the six season races so far in this discipline, she has won. After gold in 2018 in Pyeongchang, she picked silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. On a World Cup medal in her parade discipline, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving but continues to wait. At her home game at Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago, she was missing injury-related.
"I actually thought I'd be good at it. It was about hundreds of a second," Goggia said after the surprise victory of Swissman Jasmine Flury in French Méribel. "I'm disappointed. I gave it all. But so is life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal all experts expected and ultimately missed, "are they but not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been reported missing since February 10.

Selenskyj and Minister Against Russia's Olympiad
Kyiv. With calls to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Paris Olympics, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
At a joint telephone conference, it was agreed to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports reported on its website.
"We call for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympics, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė said.
The video consultation had taken place at the initiative of Britain. It had been a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made it very clear to Britain's position: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympics. We will now make a joint statement on the subject."
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj had protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terror state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Selenskyj said. He posted his speech in his Telegram channel. Because of Russia's attack war, ultimately, a neutral flag was also soaked with blood and not wearable.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a warring party because the country provides military bases for attacks on Russian troops. Selenskyj called on the officials to advocate for the protection of Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being allowed to compete. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which unfortunately lost its "honour."
The conference was the occasion of the IOC's announcement to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening to boycott should the IOC allow athletes to compete.
Federal Ministry of Home Affairs also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of Sport, which is responsible for sports, also stated at the deliberations to reject a launch of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "There is no reason from our point of view to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to the competitions. Ukrainian athletes must continue to apply the unfettered solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's aspiration to retake Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way," a spokesman for the Home Ministry informed at dpa request.
Home Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed in late January that "the sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war Putin is waged against the Ukrainian civilian population. Large sporting events are not taking place in the air-empty space." Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics need to be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sporting stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly confess to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently declared that an exclusion "due to a passport or the place of birth" violated the ban on discrimination.
Creating where it happens
"Hey, horny butt!" whispering to the Närrin in the scarce sexy costume and calling out adorable proverbs: all this falls under the concept of "catcalling" (or cat calls). Behind the concept is no less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in the public space.
Half of vehicles lost? : US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
Half of vehicles lost? US sees Moscow's tank stock heavily decimated
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the start of the war. The speech is about the "holds of the main stock."
The Russian army has already lost half of its combat armour in its attack war on Ukraine, according to estimates by the U.S. Defense Ministry. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army had been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide any further details at an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security about the number of tanks seized and destroyed, according to the U.S. estimate.
Ukraine is set to receive combat armour from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has pledged Kyiv to supply Challenger-2 fighter armour for March. Germany wants to supply a battalion of Leopard 2 tankers to Ukraine in a coalition with other states by April. The U.S. has also pledged a battalion of 31 combat tanks of the type Abrams. However, their delivery will last much longer in all foresight.
Russia wants to relay
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kreml chief Dmitri Medvedev set the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks in sight. "As we know, our enemy abroad has been bedrocketing around planes, missiles, tanks," Medvedev, who is now vice-president of Russia's Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that it is a matter of course for us in this case to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks."
Already since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia, allowing for a stronger focus of the economy on the needs of the army, which can require, for example, individual industries to supply the armed forces.
Vertebrae for post assignment with Army
The post, which the former director of the Army History Museum (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold, was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post-corruption and abuse of office. Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the action.
A tendering was not required because the appointment to a job that has so far been unoccupied, according to the minister. "Specialities of a free staff representative" did not want to comment. Ortner was replaced in the past year after 17 years at the head of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he faced heavy bullying allegations. These are cleared out of Tanner's view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts the content of Ortner, who is an expert in the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but deals with the current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process." At the decision, the "appearance of post treasurers," says SPÖ defence spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos call on Tanner to take back the appointment. The ÖVP plugs "more to the neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for state defense. He announced a parliamentary inquest on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go to their knees at expense
Thüringen's Carnival Tower of Wasungen, unlike the national capital, wants to hold on to the traditional carnival shift. However, the higher costs are difficult to cope with, among other things, for safety in washes, Carnival President Marcel Kißling says. The funds alone accounted for about half the total cost of moving.
In Brandenburg, there are no carnival shifts. The "train of cheerful people" in Cottbus, probably once again the biggest of East Germany, will take place for the first time after the pandemic. Even during the Swabian-Almanian fast night, no relocations were canceled.
Schleswig-Holstein's Carnival Tower of Marne is holding on to the traditional move despite the increased costs. "We are pulling our event through," says Carnival Society President Heiko Claußen. But here too, the financial woes are pressing: if more sponsors were not found or the previous ones had to go to the point where backlogs had to be tackled - "this is not going every year." The deficit at the moment: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: in the case of confectionary products, there is partly an increase in the price of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. Due to happiness in misfortune, too much had been ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. However, it is already clear for the move that it is becoming more expensive. For safety, twice as much staff is needed as in 2020.
Anyone who stands on the Rosenmontagszug in the Rhineland at the edge of the way might get less camels than they used to. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants don't have that much in it. Kamelle back or forth, the visitor sand rank is likely to be big: "I think if it shouldn't rain out of cubs on the day, then we can pretty much expect an elevated amount of people's sand," says Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that two years ago, there was no regular rose Monday train. The train, of course, is to be replaced by nothing."
At the expense of the festival committee in Cologne does not express itself in detail, but the train is generally "deficient", which is no secret.
The Ukraine diary: Dreams and yellow-burnt vodka
Ukrainians aren't for nothing considered drink-resistant. There are domestic beers like obolon from Kyiv or beer from Lemberg. I always discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large-scale breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't find a big difference in taste. The same applies to the vodka, which is widespread. The same applies to the vodka, which is widespread. To whom they burn, especially on the villages themselves. They call it Samargon. How much of it is consumed exactly in the former Soviet republics, no one knows. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a whopping 80 percent. Well, you also see here how little you can believe the Russians. It means, as a tourist, you should be careful with it. But that only applies if it goes into the massive sales.
FC Hansa Rostock is rewarded for a lot of effort: "Match luck on our site"
Food and drink
Anyone who wants to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or drink a beer to celebrate, find great locals in Rostock and Warnemünde for it. The restaurant scene offers plenty of locations for after-work meetings or the pre-glee for club parties. Where's it best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Cup: Federal President sees favourite win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are greeted at the arena by Schornsteinfeger master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal award at the World Cup sprint of Oberhof. But there were two glimpses of light in the fog.
As much as the federal president also tried, from the honorary gallery, it was not to be seen on Saturday whether the slices at the shooting alley actually fell. "I had to get the results over the cellphone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier shrugged, pointing to the fog swathes dragging back into the stadium that severely affected the view at the racecourse for viewers.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed the visit to the 10-km sprint race at the Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof, receiving numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympics in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier had won gold in the first race, the biathlon fascinates me," he betrayed and praised Oberhof for his modernized sporting venues: "The round-renewed arena is great and offers ideal conditions. This is also what the athletes say - thanks to those who have dealt with the World Cup since the World Cup was awarded here."
Sporting once again, the Norwegian John Thingnes split the competition. Despite a penalty round after a shooting error, he secured the sixth win in the sixth sprint of winter - and thus his second World Cup title in Oberhof. Behind him, his flawless scoring brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty lap/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian four-time victory perfect.
The native skiers couldn't step into the fight for the medals a day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting error and with a backlog of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow scored flawlessly and became Twelve (1:14.6). Two glimpses of light behind the grey veil. Conversely, Benedict Doll disappointed again. After his sparse mixed turnover on Wednesday, the Black Forest this time left five slices standing and vanished as 55. deeply disappointed and uncompromising in the cabin.
Bö had entered the race in front of 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested that status despite the intricate visibility. However, on his final two standing shots, he had the luck of the prodigious; they each ended up at the edge of the slices and fell anyway. The winner's award then enjoyed the 29-year-old then alongside his five-year-old brother: "It's the best feeling to stand with him here," the world champion said: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the chase on Sunday. On the other hand, the German hopes for Herrmann-Wick rest. "If you start with the number one, the goal is not to come in as a tenth. There is only full gas and attack to defend the number one," sporting director Felix Bitterling took his "locomotives" into duty. The organisers expect a nearly sold-out arena for the doubles event (13.25 and 3.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych misses "beetail" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on refereeing ball.
Aggressive players or meckering coaches? Germany's referees want to "consequently punish" unsports. Referee chief Fröhlich points to a role model function.
Germany's top referee Felix Brych has made up negative tendencies in co-operation on the pitch. "I already find that there are new behaviours from the players that are ringing the referee a bit like a beetail after decisions and trying to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. "That's what we discussed in the winter break. We decided we don't want to accept such insports. We're going to pay more attention to that again - and will sanction it as well."
Lastly, two coaches had also been considered with place referrals. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat to FC Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich, there was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "Also the coaching behaviour falls into the area of insports. We have noticed that insports have also grown in this area, that the behaviour has become a bit more demanding or aggressive to us referees. Even such insports we want to punish consistently," Brych said.
DFB Arbitration Judge Chief Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a fundamentally good co-operation between coaches and impartialists. "All in all, the ratio fits. There are reactions, thereafter consistent backlash follows. So the person affected must then live. This is not likely to be a world-moving thing," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"There may be conflicts in the course of the game. But if the emotionality is overflowing into a personal denigration, it must also be accepted that the appropriate measures are taken by the refereeing side," Fröhlich said. In recent cases, the parties involved would have cleared things up in the aftermath. "It would only be awhile if a rethinking process as a whole got under way that such a behaviour simply did not belong," Fröhlich said at the margins of an event hosted by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to potential impacts elsewhere. "Of course, occurrences from professional football are always coloring out. There is a role model effect, resulting from imitation. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, the referees have consistently responded to negative behaviors," Fröhlich said. "Indeed of the consistent rule interpretation in the game, a clear conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combined Oftebro wins in Schonach
After a jump from the Normalchanze and the ten-kilometre-long cross-country ski race of Norwegians Jens Luraas Oftebro, the victory secured the Austrian leader Johannes Lamparter.
The German combinators don't compete in the blackforest in the standings. Beijing Olympic champions Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek are not in it. They are preparing for the world championships with training in Oberstdorf, which will take place from February 21, to March 5 in the Slovenian Planica. "We have three world-class athletes at home. That's what the team feels, of course," federal coach Hermann Weinbuch said in the ZDF.
Seven lightly injured after crash on A5
Seven people were slightly injured in an accident involving four vehicles on Highway 5 near Hemsbach (Rhein-Neckar-Kreis), including two children. According to a statement from police, it had happened on Saturday when a motorist encountered a carriage during a slight back-to-back drive from behind and swung him at two more cars. The full lockdown of the lanes towards Heidelberg had been lifted after about an hour and a half.
Finissage at the Marler Sculpture Museum
Have the exhibition launched: the initiators Sebastian Freytag (li.) and Georg Elben (re.) stand in front of his mural with artist Christian Freudenberger.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition will end at the Marler Sculpture Museum.
The finissage for the exhibition "Wandbound" will take place at 3 p.m. on Sunday, February 12 at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarter of the Marler Skulpturenmuseum in Georg-Herwegh-Straße 63-67. Two large-scale murals draw attention in three exhibition rooms each.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted, the artworks will disappear. However, a catalogue documents the works created specifically for the Marler Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-bound art at the service of the community.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a free art historian and curator and has received his doctorate in 2013 on the wall painting of the Weimar Republic. Since then, she has been researching the history of architecture and the history of art and institutions of the post-war period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on art at the construction in NRW. Following the lecture, the last curator tour takes place through the exhibition. The artists and artists are on site.
Arrest warrants after building crashes in Turkey
It is about tree gaps that have favoured the collapse of buildings: in the Turkish earthquake region, judicial authorities have issued a warrant against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued in the south of Turkey after building crashes during the earthquake. Arrest warrants have been issued in the city of Diyarbakir for possible tree defects. Arrest warrants were issued in the city of Diyarbakir, the state news agency Anadolu reported on Saturday, invoking criminal prosecutions. The accused are said to be responsible for tree defects that would have favoured the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the prosecutor's office in Adana also determines because of possible tree defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it was called. One of the accused is said to have been taken at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and, meanwhile, sit in pre-trial detention, Anadolu reported. Nine other people were then arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.
In the early hours of Monday morning, a quake of magnitude 7.7 had rocked the Turkish-Syrian border area, followed by another quake of magnitude 7.6 at midday. More than 7,500 buildings have collapsed in Turkey alone.
Former Prime Minister Hans Modrow died
Hans Modrow is dead, as the left-wing faction reported in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old died in the night to Saturday. Group chairman Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and left-wing politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow was gone from us at 95," the left-wing faction in the Bundestag shared on Saturday, losing "a significant personality," group chairman Dietmar Bartsch and former group chief Gregor Gysi explained.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the first secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As prime minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on 13 November 1989, he became chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for about 150 days. In the popular chamber elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost office a month later. He succeeded him as the last prime minister of the GDR until the reunification of CDU politicians Lothar de Maizière.
In a message on the short news service Twitter, the group chairman of the left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist." Bartsch added:
"By age he was a key advisor to our party, whose cleverness will be missing."
"The whole peaceful course of the production of German unity was just a special merit of him. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. Further, it states:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS, always consisted of representing also that part of the former GDR population that was not wanting and whose interests were regularly violated."
Following the reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag between 1990 and 1994 and represented the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow had seen the new state as "utterly critical." Too quickly German unity had been carried out, too unconditionally the GDR had gone under, and too unilaterally it had been condemned as an "unlawful state," Modrow had criticised in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened at night
Ukraine's President Volodomyr Selenskyj condemns Russian missile strikes, but Kyiv must do emergency repairs on the electricity grid.
Kyiv - The latest wave of Russian missile strikes is once again forcing emergency repairs on the Ukrainian energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several heat and hydroelectric power stations have been damaged, the head of energy supplier Ukrenerho, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television on Friday night. It looks particularly bad with the power supply in the Kharkiv area. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian electricity grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the AKW Chmelnyzkyj. Production was throttled at the Rivne and southern Ukraine nuclear power stations.
President Volodymyr Selenskyj condemned the Russian attack with about 100 missiles and marching missiles on Friday as a terror. In a video message, he reported to his compatriots how much support Ukraine had experienced in its trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to let the small town of Bachmut down
February 24 - War has prevailed for a year. U.S. President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland just before the anniversary. However, the danger of Russian missile strikes also continued into Saturday. In the capital Kyiv, for the fifth time for that day, air alerts were triggered late Friday night. "It threatens an attack with drones," the military administration of the Kyiv area shared. Fighting drones of Iranian design were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolaiv and Odessa areas in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Bund selects Adviser for Network Company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens from the campaign to divide them failed in the coalition partner SPD. In the Coalition Treaty, it had agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure society, which should, however, be common-sense-oriented in the future. In other words, it does not need to make gains and pay off.
Remediation of EUR 80 billion
The two advisory firms are intended to help the Federal Government to accompany this process. The refurbishment of the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently very uninterrupted. Transport Minister Wissing has set out to eliminate this maladministration with the complete refurbishment of all rail corridors. The investments necessary for this have been estimated at EUR 50 billion so far. However, according to recent calculations of the railway, they are more likely to be worth up to €80 billion.
Biathlon World Cup in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can anyone please pin me?"
The outer circumstances had certainly not spoken for Herrmann-Wick. She would have slept badly, she told after the race, had been "totally excited" who had not come down the pulse even when he walked in. "So a race," and that at the home World Cup, "you can't describe that with words," she said. 11,000 viewers joked about the draughty stroke music with Germany flags, supervisors and team falling into the arms.
" Enjoy biathlon," she had made herself
The pressure had been particularly high for Herrmann-Wick. The 34-year-old had started as the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope away from the seasons to the World Cup. Herrmann-Wick has won the world championship as the only German to win two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she currently ranks fifth. And even though the performance density in the women's standings is much higher than in the men's, where at the moment only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, one had others on the zeal for that sprint win.
Criticism of government - Bishop sentenced to 26 years in prison in Nicaragua
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing freedom of religion. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been heavily tense since 2018. At the time, protesters calling for the resignation of Ortegas had found refuge in churches. At the protests, more than 350 people had died in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrests. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of forging a composure to his fall along with the U.S. government.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry demands more orders from special assets
First arms projects have therefore already been deleted, further projects threaten the same as the "World on Sunday" reports. Which investments would actually be scrapped, but could not yet be said. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to any savings requirements at this time," says the Federal Government in response to a request from the Bundestag MP Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment is the rising interest rates. The fully credit-funded special asset decided by the Bundestag in June 2022 must bear the interest rate burden on the loans itself. If they rise, so less money is available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. Moreover, due to the current high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining sum is falling.
Copper cell: accident with 3 injured
At the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 p.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive to the motorway on the Kupferzell motorway to the left towards Heilbronn. At that point, a 21-year-old VW driver drove the B 19 towards Künzelsau, as police reported. At the turn of the BMW driver, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both of those involved in the accident stated that the traffic light installation installed at the site of the accident showed "green" for them. A review of the traffic light system revealed no complaints. Further investigations follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be taken to a hospital. The two cars had a total damage of around 20,000 euros.
Stuttgart Castle Square commemorates victims of earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgarters followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib Mosque on Friday night
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria, with a large proportion of them also in Stuttgart.
At Stuttgart Castle Square, more than 200 people thought and prayed for them on Friday night.
A lot of community members had followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib Mosque community, boys like the old, women as well as men. They all listened seriously and silently to the imam's prayer. In prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they could also overcome this disaster. He asked, among other things, for health, protection against plagues and respectful dealing with each other. The community also asked help and force to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake."
Ditib is on the sidelines of the people of Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration event. The prayers were also translated into German in the Castle Square.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great, and several million euros have already been gathered in the donation campaign of the German Islamic Association of the Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib).
The Alevitian community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected property donations in the bellows over several days, which are to be transported to the earthquake areas by truck, where the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hiking with meat deposit - Ebersberg
"After eating, you're supposed to rest or do a thousand steps".... The elders know the proverb, the disciples just put it into practice. So or so, in the years of the pandemic, the good, old digestive walk has experienced an unspoilt renaissance. For those who, thanks to home office, are not sitting in the middle of a stone's throw away from the screen or just a stone's throw away from the screen or just substituted for a walk to the fresh air. At least you could gain this impression around Lake Egglburg, where between 12 and 2 p.m., it's not just dog owners who are trolling.
One reason could also be because the human being of the modern age can connect the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things in the course of an optimal time slot use. Because why not experience news from the settlement on the occasion of a short march through the nature of the long-not seen neighbor? Or meet the friend, with whom you never manage to get to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema? Also, in this way, you could connect the profession and private life - who says that the appointment can't take place outdoors with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor? Unless foreign ears are nearby, of course.
What you can also do in a good way is the purchase of natural fruits. Fresh fruit, for example, which is on top of a table at the edge of the path. Or potatoes and meat. Just fool you if you don't think about the purchase in advance and have taken appropriate precautions. For example, an older couple in Hinteregglburg leave the farmer's wooden sales room with blank hands and regrets in the voice. "Sorry, unfortunately, we forgot the money."
The disappointment can be felt, but you have yourself a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What you let know of the sympathetic coincidence? What the man responds to: "That's not true, but you very probably have a bag in it!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat insertion and, on this lunchtime short trip, it has become richer not only for a lamb’s back, but also for a very practical idea. Well possible that a second walk will be due on that day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Clamped and seriously injured
At around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove with his Audi on the circle road towards Hailfingen and came off the road from the road to the right for a left turn to the right, according to the police report. In doing so, the Audi damaged a steering post, crashing sideways against a tree and staying a few metres away. Through the collision, the driver got stuck in his car. The fire brigade cleared him with heavy equipment. The rescue service took the seriously injured to a hospital. As the suspicion of driving incompetence persisted, the withdrawal of a blood sample was ordered. Total damage of € 1,000 arose at the Audi, according to police report.
Donald Trump's tax records: Point for the rule of law
The U.S. Department of Justice has ruled that the financial authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump in 2018, still in office of President of the United States
The Ministry of Finance had to instruct the tax authority IRS to issue the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the ministry's decision stated Friday.
Contrary to political practices in the U.S., real estate contractor Trump had not made his tax declaration public either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted a subpoena until the Supreme Court. A New York prosecutor's office has since obtained the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless it comes to a trial.
The issue to Congress is arguably more delicate for Trump: there, the circle of accessees is a little bigger and under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation, and in addition, the House keeps intrusive.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promptly hailed the decision as a "win for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records was a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his hollowing of our security as president," Pelosi explained.
Cabaret in the Bastion: Between birth and death, life plays out
Kirchheim. Pasta or Pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which cellphone contract at the many offers? Stay or end? Either - or? As slaves of time, people from today heave from appointment to appointment and sometimes people and Hamburgers just push in between. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "between" condition has something agitating.
In a humorously thoughtful way, Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings situations out of life. In her sensitive Chansons and crunchy-pointed cabaret songs, she brings a lot of things to the point - and the one or the other is also between the lines. Loss goes on Saturday, February 18, at 8:30 p.m. at the Kirchheim Club Bastion.
British serious criminal arrested after long escape in Thailand
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug offender has been taken from the UK in Thailand. As British crime police told NCA on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police on Friday at a car shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of criminals most wanted by the NCA.
The leader of a criminal group had fled a trial in early 2018, in which he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for attempting to import amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros).
Meetings at the church table

Cabaret - stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: the studied physicist from Unterfranken, who has lived in Vienna for three years and loves the Viennese humour according to his own statements, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo, "Make Science Great Again," fits well in here in the generally prevailing domestic skepticism. His humour, at any rate, fits very well with Vienna.
The English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, but he tried to get a foothold for a year in New York as a stand-up comedian. Now he's back there, telling his German-speaking audience not only about the experiences of overseas, but also explaining what knowledge-aft actually is and what it can and what, and most importantly, it can't. Of course, coronavirus is happening, but also German soundness on the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many push before: What really matters? All with a huge eye-width, unexcited and very ironic. And so not only are they well entertained, but they can also learn something about it.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the fighting from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are held in a wide valley completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley level are rock pyramids and rock squadrons that provide the player with preliminary protection, as they can't be destroyed by opposing shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving chain vehicles and fast super tankers, as well as flash rockets, which, during the extended playtime, are increasingly difficult to hit. Additionally, UFO's appear to be still appearing at periodic intervals. These can't attack the player's filler. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score through a UFO encounter. The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) different operating types. These are the attraction sequence, the game induction sequence, the game abbreviation, the initial entry for maximum results and the self-testing process. The latter type of operation represents a special process for checking the controls and computer function.
4. Gameplay
The game is triggered when the START pressure switch is activated. The LED switch remains lit and the playing noises become audible. If the last player's tank is eliminated from the enemy attacker, a game has ended. The game starts with slow-moving tanks visible on the screen. The position of the respective enemy tanks or rockets can be determined by paying attention to the displayed text in the upper left hint display angle of its cockpit. An indication can be e.g. loud: GEGNER OF RECHTS. Additionally, a point is visible on the wide-ranging radar screen, accompanied by a sonar-BLIP tone, which represents the enemy position.
If the opponent is in this area, it is good to typify it on the screen, and then it is displayed at the top left of the screen.
At times, UFO's will be visible on the screen flying over the battlefield. This is a dangerous flight body that observes the fight and cannot eliminate the opponent or the player's tank. The UFO's are said to round off the fighter and distract the player as they usually appear at the same time with opposing tanks or rockets. A shot by the player brings this 5,000 points. If a slow-moving tank hits 1,000 points, for a rocket 2,000 points and for a Super-Panzer 3,000 points. A Super-Panzer drives and turns twice as quickly as the player's tank or an opponent's slow-moving tank. Several options give the viewer the opportunity to use for a game sequence 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks. Furthermore, after reaching predetermined scores, a bonus tank can be cleared and for another more difficult game design, the appearance of the rocket
5. Initial input at maximum results
If a player exceeds the minimum point number in the table of maximum results, then ER or YOU can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after playing. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It must be noted that with the triggering of a self-tests, the bending of the RESET button on the Battlezone analog vector generator PCB or an interruption of the grid voltage, the table with the maximum results is deleted. When deleting (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores are obtained with their initials and re-inscribed on the screen to challenge further players. Each score that is above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their pders within 60 seconds, they will be auto-matically inscribed by the computer. Hereafter, the device changes back to the
1. New parts
The device BATTLEZONE has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with video devices from ATARI, you should note these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This one is a reconstruction of the ATARI locking lever. It has been reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, thus ensuring this building unit is more stable and a proper function of the switch contacts. Another amendment is the centrifugal beam made of rubber, which, like a centrifugal spring, has the control lever and the auxiliary board. With the help of displaced switching techni k, more lines are generated on the screen with a higher speed, given the extension of the circuit. D. The static housing. Due to the new design, it has now been possible to insert a new box with a larger coin-casting capacity. Furthermore, in the device, a console
These new components, as well as all other main components of this device, are shown in figure 1. If one of these new components is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. Device Inspection
After removing the packaging, this new consumer device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should perform a certain review to round off the quality control. To be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following controls should be performed: NOTE: Do not connect the device to the 220 V network yetBen. A. Inspect the housing outer side for damage. B. Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components within the device as follows: (1) Check all cable tree plugs for correct and fixed connection. Connect any open or loose plugs.
NOTE: Connectors never violently produce. The plugs are fitted with a forced guide so that a correct connection is produced. A 180 degree twisted plug connection destroys the PCB.
(2) Check plug connections to the play PC board for correct and fixed seating. (3) Note the device's manufacturing number on the type plate on the device back. Check if the punched manufacturing number is consistent with those of the Battlezone analog vector generator PC board, auxiliary PC board, controller/audio II PC board and TV monitor for flawless assembly. (5) A picture of the attachment of the manufacturing number is located on the cover voltage and the TV monitor for flawless assembly. (4) A look through the display glass of the player is to check whether the radar screen is also in the light, orange-enclosed opening of the clasp and should be re-aligned. Before the device is connected to the power supply, ensure that the voltage picker on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local power supply voltage. Check the cable color at the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
Here are a number of tips that can help you solve most problems with current DirectX games. Check the system configuration
Please take the time and check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. Using the DirectX diagnostics program, you can get an overview of your system if you are not sure if your PC meets the requirements. Please click on the "Start" button and select "Execute" option. Now you will see the user interface of the DirectX diagnostics program. You can check, among other things, whether graphics and sound function properly by clicking on the corresponding buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer knowledge, we would advise you to change any of the options in the DirectX Diagnostic Program. Before starting the game, you will need to check whether you have access to all relevant system details, including information about the graphics and sound card.
It may happen that other programs take into account the system resources that the game requires to run flawlessly. Not all of these programs are obvious that they are active, and many are automatically booted up. Such programs, which are constantly active on their system, are called "background applications." In some cases, they may be the cause of your program hanging or crashing, so we recommend that you close or disable such background applications before you start the game. Search the symbol of the program in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and choose the appropriate option ("Deactivate" "Close," or similar). - Once you have deactivated the antivirus and crash guard programs, you should also end general background applications, as these sometimes lead to problems when you install or execute a PC game. More to do this, read the section "How to end all unnecessary background applications."
Before installing software, make sure your hard drive works optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need are supplied with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmentation and Data Media Cleaning so that everything runs flawlessly. Then the chances are that up-to-date games run largely smoothly on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus also other applications that you otherwise use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to find out about the tools ScanDisk or error check, defragmentation and data carrier cleanup. Use Windows Help
1. Click the Start button and choose Help (or Help and Support) to access Windows Help. 2. Now click the Search field and type the corresponding keyword, such as "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Check" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmentation" and "Data Cleaning." You will then get a guide to how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card, so you can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First you should try to download the latest drivers from the graphics card manufacturer's website. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INFORMATION
The desire to develop video games was sparked by the emergence of the 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expressing the world through which it was possible to get to grips with the world's boundaries. It presented me with a chance to discover new horizons. I imagined that even though it may be quite skeptical that driving can help to get into this new creative path and offer it with their own inspirations, their talent and ambition. In the past two years, driving has become a huge part of our life and presented us with the opportunity to discover all the basics of the game. In the past two years, driving has become a huge part of our life and presented us with the opportunity to discover all the basic principles that were previously perceived as irreverent principles. I would be happy when driving - similar to books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression

SERVICE-PROGRAMM
For programming and testing, the 4 switches, the self-test button and the LEDs are used on the video PC board.
Programming display. With this display, the language (English, French, spanish, German), with which the address program and the game work, is selected. With the help of the "sub-test" switch, the "test" switch can be set to the first line, and the hit points can be set to the screen. The value is set back, the pointer (so the green score value x 10 000) is determined to transfer to the first line (names) and the hit points to the screen. The value is set back, the pointer (so the green score value x 10 000) is determined to transfer the high score pointer to the next program ad to the next program ad. The value is determined by pressing the pointer (so the green score value x 10 000) is determined to transfer the high score pointer to the next program ad to the next program ad. The value is determined to determine the difficulty factor for the device.
"threshold": height of the % number to be reached to switch to the next passage
"time limit": Release for additional savings
"Difficulty": difficulty of the game
"Dress up": at "0" no sound at stand
for "1" sound also in stand mode (Animierton) "table model": for "0" stand
for "1" tableware
The credits per coin are set on the "shoulder" display. High score program display (heavy rate to now"). The scoring points and initials of the player, including the 10 next scores, appear. The values are used to adjust to high scores chosen on the previous display (setting "back"). By pressing the "Up" switch, the next program display will be set at 0. The total number can only appear at 0 when the battery or the plug-in connection W1 is set at 0. Right-handed coins: Number of credits given by the device. % Free spins: Number of minutes paid, in the case of extended or won game. % Leisure: Wound minutes/played minutes per 100. Average play duration in sec.: Played minutes/Payed + granted loans
High Score (Treffer rate): Number of players having enough high hit odds to push other players out of the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are set at 0. Pressing the "Test" switch will appear the next program display.
Injection Slot Programming/Normal Money Setting With the help of this display, a default coin setting can be selected or a different setting can be programmed
If a default setting is foreseen, the program is selected while the top number is green on the screen. The size values change with the change of the digit. When reaching the right setting by pressure on the "Test" switch, the adjustment is taken to 0, which means that the values can be increased or reduced by pressing the "Test" switch, the default setting is set. When the lower values are unchanged, the default setting is set to 0, which means that the values can be increased or reduced. When the lower values are unchanged, the default setting is set to 0, which means that the values can be increased or reduced by pressing the "Test" switch, the default setting is set to 0, which means that the values can be increased or reduced. When the lower values are unchanged, the default setting is set to indicate how many coin units are close to each - by an assigned slot - a thrown coin is given. Coin units - "Kredit" shows
When "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, stored in dom all the programming, is out. All the values stored in the RAM will be set to factory default. This condition will likely indicate battery failure or error.
FEHLERSUCHE and SECTIONS
Beginning of the test method. Print the "Sub Test" switch or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 close to the LED display). All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can start. The tests and settings can be entered to the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" switch, the next program will be displayed. If a permanent test of the video board is required, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the auto test mode. When the display "Open Coin Door to Test" (open the coin door to test) appears, the program plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. When the display J 19 is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = from / I = a / X = Test results
The ROM check sum calculates the test total of each video ROM and compares it to the amount stored for this ROM. If a difference exists, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the false test sum appears on the LED's. If the check total ROM is error hofed, the first U 10 is displayed. Gels this test does not, must be exchanged the next one displayed on the LED display. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be imported as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is chosen by the decoder plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the video board
The Communications RAM test determines the function security of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking if storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 When holding the Gerdt with the o.a. display, an error has been discovered. If the Communications RAM is running out during the video board test, the error may have arisen through a faulty wiring (RAM) or error in the data board. To locate the error, decrease the data board of P 6 and repeat the test. A failure means error in the U 3, U 4 or related power circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values are enrolled in another part of the memory, CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test is passed, all storage points are set to their previous value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device is holding with the above display, an error is present. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated power circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing pre-defined number strings in the color RAM. These numbers will be checked for accuracy when reading back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, an error is present. Check U 56, U 57, related multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is checked by enrolling a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared to the original pattern. Any discrepancy brings the program to hold and the LEDs indicate the faulty RAM. When an display RAM fails, the problem is detected and the RAM replaces. If this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 to LED's), it is shown that the next check is started (Data Hardware). The connection to the data processor must be present and it must be operational.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star No 1. The 2nd for the proper jacket to arrive without any recognizable seam flaws. ABER I was probably too happy for this jacket because the disappointment was all the bigger. I was oriented towards the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Because she should sit so tight and I did not want to fight in a S or M at my top.... In the end effect she would have fit from the length and at the hips...in the rest I could swim. Moreover, the lining material arrived at the opening of the package and distributed everywhere. Just just shame.. She will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good processing
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered them for our daughter, she is totally excited. She otherwise wears the 158 and you fit the 36 in this case very well and is sure to be worn the next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I decided for the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the car lifter and this is not optimal. Unfortunately, I measured myself and the condition doesn't quite fit. But what my mistake is. Did then slightly change so it fits. The condition looks very robust and you can no longer damage the knives. You can use the use or the whole area. It works without problems. It slips nix more. I'd buy again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product in itself I'm completely okay, but not under a year. Since the area to chew is far too big for the little mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months and he couldn't use it for the size. Now at 12 months, we've been looking for him again and he can use it. Didn't even bite anything with his already existing teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it bothers him a lot.
Quality not sufficient / unfortunately goes back
I've probably been blinded here by the sometimes excessive reviews. I would like to say that I have already used 2 rucksacks from Lowepro. One very big (to store the equipment) and a pretty little one for the most important, everyday things that you have to keep up with. As a result, I have bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (knapp 29 EUR) and I am really happy about this protection, as my Lowepro can't say. So I decided for myself that the rucksack is much thinner and the materials of the compartments for the little stuff aren't really high-quality. The padded walls are much thinner and the materials of the compartments for the little stuff aren't really high-quality. I decided for myself that the backpack is much thinner and the materials of the compartments for the little stuff aren't to compare. So I decided
Unfortunately disappointed by the third part
So far I had liked the electrics series of E. L. Todd, but my opinion was revisited with this book. The first two books I found very strong and also highly recommended and I really enjoyed the third part. In the part goes all the time about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn to the length. Taylor jokes about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn to the length. Taylor jokes about the whole time about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily drawn to the length.

a quiet, sensitive movie
Some expect a movie à la 8 Mile here. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be at all. This FIlm is mainly "French" - it's also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and brings you to a wine-making experience - if you get into it and don't expect anything from it, which he doesn't want to be at all.
Problematic
Fear like Quench from the 90s, from because of orange, but that doesn't matter either. 5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, but nothing at all. My belly size has grown by 12 cm! Blows like never before! Afterward diarrhoea 5-8 times a day. Little helpful, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhoea has already stayed for 1 week. It is worth noting that with the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (sorry seen only too late), with the bigger full 5 ? This is very strange!
Fearful stencil and low result! I dyed my blonde hair in a chocolate brown in October, in February/March I used this hair color remover. I applied the product twice. The first time I noticed that it stinks terribly! However, there was a not too bad result, it came out in about chestnut brown (something dark). Since I did not achieve my desired result, I used it, as in the guidance also with not satisfied result, again. This time it was pure waste of time! It did not make any difference, my hair looked like with the first attempt. What was the worst, it still stung weeks after application.. No matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just didn't disappear.
Very recommended
I am now taking the tablets for a longer time and always taking a tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a longer time because of my work, too little exercise and a longer supplementary illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only through healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2 a little bit of the jumps. This also works out in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I feel better and I get better out of bed. The price is also super as you have to remember how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
Function not completely flawless !!! After 3 months of use of the battery case I discovered the following gross defects, which I feel are very disturbing: 1) The case has problems with the mobile phone to "connect" over time. This means that when you remove the phone from the case and reinstall it, you solve the problem in 70% of the cases, but this creates a new shortage. 2) By removing frequently and re-installing the phone in the case, the lid is now so worn out that it itself dissolves from the case, which is why I would have lost it several times. These are not many gross defects, but I find that a case with battery should function flawlessly and therefore, for the cost of €30, I am very disappointed with the product, especially because I have only used it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and no better. I promised myself much more of these cloths it is also really very thin. Since I used it I can no longer exchange it, unfortunately I am disappointed and I can't recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far more than 2 euros.
I'm two-fleet at the frequency response
I bought this loudspeaker for the shower when my smaller free loudspeaker, which I got as an advertising gift, unfortunately broken. Basically, the onforu works great, is water-resistant (mir shcon fell into the shower), gives bass like bass again, Bluetooth works great... suction cup must naturally irrigate, otherwise it dissolves.. he can play sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small loudspeaker. As I say, bass is played as bass and not converted into a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are played very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the singing are already very quiet, higher and deeper frequencies remain good enough. My old loudspeaker has not played well as bass, but the frequencies were quite natural. At the Onforu, unfortunately,
Very bad
The color was fragmented and if you only went over it with your hand the color dropped off to some. We wanted them to pick them up for free because we didn't want them to have them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense . They would only replace the damaged part but as if both of them were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and remit the money back to us. A LOB to Amazon
Spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Supplied individual parts that you need to stick together. The product was packed in a simple envelope, made of thin cardboard. A few templates were damaged. I did not regret it because I needed this product as a matter of urgency. The included glue hardly holds but sticks neatly - like chewing gum which does not get hard. Even a day after glueing, almost half of the templates from the wood stick are dropped off. You have to pay attention to the fact that not everything sticks with each other. The templates are partly incompletely punched out. For the one-off use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and reach for a high-quality product.
Don't be unhappy. The closet looks good and is easy to build, even though the instructions aren't so clear. + magnetic closing + beautiful optics + stable when built up + shelf board can be positioned anywhere
- Doors bang through magnets (maybe you can offset with rubber buttons) - some unspoilt spots
- Included dowels are far too small and wobbled (had no others and had them stuck in the house, stuck with craft stickers) - the holders for the inlay floor wobble something (have wrapped up with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If he wouldn't look that good and would have such good dimensions, I'd give fewer stars, as you have to do everything to be really happy, and I find him a little too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes me....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In that respect, I would have forgiven 5*. Sadly, the coffee doesn't run evenly through (if ever!). Even the extra plastic waste (individually packed s.Photo) means a star deductible for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and soon cashes full score.
Go to the alarm clock
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and exceedingly loud to it. I couldn't put them quieter either. Probably a defect, supposedly, that's possible. The quietest radio setting was too loud to me, as I think it's already tomorrow. I always woke up when I had turned to the alarm clock with my face because I thought it was already tomorrow. When it is, though, and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright to me. The colours and also the color change I found beautiful, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. Good I also found that he has a battery so that in case of a power outage, the clock and wake-up time don't need to be re-entered. Ging, however, returned for the reasons mentioned.
Light super, processing insufficient
I replaced four light bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a version - instead, I laughed at a board at this point... It also lay nothing in the carton. "6 paying - 4 getting" is not a good deal. Definitely Amazon would have determined this as my mistake and I live with it. The light in itself is super. The rooms are now very bright and evenly illuminated. The light colour is more likely to reach in the direction of cold white. For hallways, workrooms, work room, washbasin, etc. For living rooms, I would grip personally to warmer light. Through with a good old 100 watt bulb, though, I can also get intact specimens corresponding to the order. Should my evaluation be a help, I am happy about a positive review. Questions I try to answer quickly.
Great
I got gestures, and I'd like to share my first look. Yes positive. I've long thought if I order this set, or not. ** The material is stable and it's good in hand. **The soft silicone all scratches expensive cookware and pots and is particularly practical to use on pans with coating. **They're heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. **You don't relay the heat either and with it can be directly tapped. **The dishwasher, though, sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swipe and they're gone. Finally, I have to say I'm very surprised and I can only recommend
B goods sold as new goods
Amazon Prime shipping simply tip. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked. Here we found that the part has already been installed. The screws/connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we saw the part in the sink itself scratch marks / clasp. This part was probably delivered and sent back again. We keep this faucet and build the one in the basement because it doesn't look like it looks. Our conclusion; never again do we order such goods via Amazon but prefer to give a little more in the building market from where we get ordered goods. Find it just sad that customers are so distraught!!!
Product in itself top, external sensor unfortunately broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very happy with this product. The installation was very simple, and the radio range is very good, there are no problems with transmitting from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use the device that seems to have broken the values outside is broken. At the same time, the thermometer seems to be still intact, here they continue to display plausible values. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is well displayed, because it always displays completely astronomical values of the outdoor humidity. This is very damaging, as the device has been mounted outside on a protected spot and also the reason why I give this product only two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at the delivery stand is still driving under with Hermes through the Republic today, without finding the way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service was superb with the triggering of a replacement delivery as always. The mower quickly arrived at me and made a worthwhile impression. The engine is strong and it results in a nice cut. The volume is not just impressively low, but ok. Big manko, unfortunately, is the catching basket. Firstly, it's just dropped up and down from hard plastic and in between fabric. If it's completely just short, then it will naturally be pressed together and parts of the content drop out. What's worse, though, is that the actual practical level gauge is already at half-full of the cut stuff. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower isn't losing from there to big chunks of the cut.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device simply lets you integrate via the app. Very good is the included sensor cable, which can also be extended if needed. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to protect the battery only once to three times a day (adjustable) is displayed in the app. For the following reasons, I only give 4 stars. - The soft back panel of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only quite fuzzyly close again. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network. Unfortunately, the device doesn't reconnect itself, even if you put it close to the router. You need to take the batteries out and put it in the vicinity of the router. You need to take the batteries out and put it back in after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, to this day I still did not manage to level the hotbed properly. The right fixing screw is completely drawn still there the hotbed is still too high and the front right the screw falls almost out because it is not at all attracted, though the hotbed is still too low. The rods that are holding the carriage just as well as the table also. Maybe someone knows what you can do as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what you can do, because so it is impossible to print something out. To the structure: The structure was quite problemless you could only show how to put the cables because you need to relay the cables otherwise, which is very hard. Support I have already written but still not get a response after a week of waiting. Unfortunately, sending back does not go back. I expected a little more.
robust and precise are positively surprised
After many years, my old transducer unfortunately gave up the spirit, so had to produce a new one. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. With this, two batteries are so that you can get started straight away. The packing of the slider is simple, but fully and completely their purpose. Otherwise, the slider does not leave any wishes open and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full score for this and think it holds at least as long as the old gauge. From there there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument just belongs to every household.
Emotional, lasting smell
Didn't buy the armband and once didn't wear it, as it flows out an eerie smell. To this day, this smell hasn't gone away, though it has been permanently "ventilated." After return is no longer possible, I disposed of it. Rate from purchase
For the price ok
The stars and baubles on this cetacean have come to me personally a little too big, so it acts quite massively. The bigger ball is freely moving, which I find very nice again. However, the chain is very easy to process in total, so I have already tossed up the closure twice. So far I have been able to fix it all the time, but I think that will not go/hold well for a long time. But for the cheap price you simply can't wait for anything really high quality.
Very nice jewelery
A beautifully worked bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just need to pull the end through it, it can't go up, amazing! I've rubbed it in with some leather care, making it even softer and tighter. Only: whoever has something magnetic on the arm: the clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately scrap! Disappointed I was already after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I felt like it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to function: Connects only after some playtime.... Keeps to the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I have removed a battery from the base station and re-introduced, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy didn't last long, because after an hour the connection was gone again, and that even though the stations were lying next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all, for me, this was not to be used! The thing went back! Would at any rate fry from a purchase, only bring annoyance!
Transport damage
Hello, this garden pump I had once, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the inner wave had been rusted. I bought it again only for a reason, I desperately needed it because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction pipe as well as the discharge would fit. I hope that the wave at the previous pump had a production fault and the current pump would perform its services a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had a transport damage, the art off housing had torn and the ventilation slits broken. The carton was also damaged from the outside, so I'd recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled cardboard. I kept the pump anyway, as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the artoff housing did not affect the pump power.
If you could think about it better, I thought I was so comfortable when the whole time was running around with a huge key chain. At the beginning everything went pretty well. However, quite quickly the paint goes off and the screws had to always be pulled. A suitable slit screwdriver I didn't find, which couldn't immediately ruin the whole thing. But to get to the most annoyed one to get the whole thing apart. The attachment of the keys to itself is simply a patience, balance and skill play. Ultimately, when I have to mount the screw in the thread and so that the complete thing is unusable. Conclusion: If at all for just once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can buy yourself a cheaper alternative.
Don't quite match the specified dimensions
Lightweight zippers, the material acts robustly and all in feather weight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will actually be able to assess the goods after the first application. In advance I can say that the height is less than stated. At the moment I can already say that the height is less than stated. At the moment I can't really imagine that everything is packed there, for example for a three-week holiday. Emergencyly, the really big parts can be delivered directly into the suitcase - as has so far. Not to mention that not 8, but 10 parts have been delivered, as in the round cosmetic bag there were two smaller bags/bags included. Not high-quality processed, I wanted to mention that anyway. That the cosmetic bag has a different shade and consists of other material than the other bags, don't bother me personally. The price-performance ratio I see as a tester price and that's
So lala
So, before Christmas ordered and worked until after Christmas. Now that I wanted to use him again, he didn't do it again. Battery? Exchanged. But he still doesn't. So the money I could have tasted straight into the bin as well.
Care is always good! The application is easy, but you should go very carefully with the brushing to not damage the needle. I could not listen to an improvement of the sound with my very high-quality plate player.
Long battery life
The earphones are wonderfully protected. With this in mind, two black cables were available. The battery life was very long. Definitely perfectly enough sound. I like that the earphones aren't painy even after long wearing and therefore very comfortable. The earcups are totally soft and pleasant to wear. The weight is also very small. Purchase recommendation in this price class.
chic dress
Very nice dress, which is good wearable for a wide variety of occasions.. Price-performance is fully consistent here, especially since I got it in the lightning range. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm happy I didn't order it any smaller (whether it was recommended). I just wished that the neckline wouldn't be that deep, and the sleeves could tolerate a little more fabric (if you don't quite have as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all, a chic dress for many occasions.
Fingers away. Bad things don't. I really and seriously didn't expect such a scrap to be sold nowadays. The drive is run on a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It is assumed that the USB ports supply enough power. Nevertheless, a faultless operation of this drive isn't possible. DVD usually goes, Blu-rays are maximally unreliable. The discs usually need to be restarted on multiple occasions, after which it will finally be detected. After minutes you can either restart the computer because it won't get anything or the disc will finally be detected. Then you can either restart the computer because it doesn't get any more or the disc will finally be detected.

Is what it is supposed to do, but isn't pretty. First of all, I want to emphasise that the two USB ports are actually eyewitnesses, because only the port pointing upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging any devices and therefore relatively useless. That's why I was a little disappointed. I actually needed a second port and I just needed a sneering extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought this in-shaped lump with golden plugs. But from the optics and my misappreciation, the extension fulfils their service very reliably. And by the weight of the plug, the plug-in USB stick doesn't just pee around in the area, as with a very normal extension cord. So no real misbuying, but my euphoria is stuck within tight limits :-).
Small but oho! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also push data back and forth. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters that I had to send back could unfortunately not. Practical is the HDMI output. I now have a PS4 controller by BT on the tablet and that the HDMI on the TV. At the same time, the HDMI output is out. I have a PS4 controller by BT on the tablet and that the HDMI on the TV.

A lot of performance
Top device. Led for months without problems. Isn't just light or quiet but brings neat performance. I find the center position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather a little too cool and I'm always on level 2. I've also fallen on the tile floor several times and survived it well. And the simple design I like, too. Competitive products look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference is very large compared to the original but does not make a favourable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weak battery
We've had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode, the score is 0.5m accurate. In offline mode, if the dog is in the house, he likes to jump by a few metres, but wouldn't bother. Would buy him again at all times. What would be great, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently, it would last about 1.5h days. Here's a solution super that would create 7-14 days. There's an XL version but unfortunately this one is too big for our taste, so long as the battery doesn't need to last and change daily, we also find impractical. You shouldn't be dealing with the dog with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of rubbish
We've already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and seem comfortable too. However, the lifespan is diminishing. Although my son wears the shoes only in sports lessons, the sole goes broken already after a few weeks and the shoes can't continue to be used. For the last couple, it was also in normal use that they didn't last very long, but I thought for the lesson it will be enough. Sadly, that wasn't that way. The shoes are expensive rubbish and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately went broken after 5 years so I ordered new ones with joy. Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance. Comfortable they are just like the ones I had previously owned. At first glance they don't seem to be noticeable either, but at the second glance you realize that the edges are poorly processed and the holding tape at the heel sits quite casually and very probably won't hold for five years like my previous ones. I'm eager!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very sceptical. However, since I would like to go to a festival this year and like to sleep in the car, I have ordered them to be good luck. To the mattress: I tested them in the car (Citroen Berlingo). At the same time, I noticed that there was a bit of a lying-in-cheek and I hope that this one is not back up. The mattress is well-placed and fits super to the festival. The air pump has different adapters. The mattress needs two different adapters that are also to be found at the pump. However, the mattress has different adapters. The mattress needs two different adapters that are also to be found at the pump. So it fits perfectly. The air pump has different adapters, it can fix it and pumped up the mattress in zero Komma Nix. Overall, I am very excited about
Definitely no more than 10€... Sadly the calendar of me only gets two stars. :( 1. For the quick shipping. 2. For the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn up by the lopsided processing directly on day 1 over several doors. On the 21st door there were no more doors on it and I had to take more or less my son that it had to take the rest of the parts out so that they had to take the rest of the parts out so that they had to get the parts out. The parts come out more often, which often means that you have to build the car again to bring the parts on. (Mostly the front panel. This one can also be attached very badly.) I would no longer buy this calendar and recommend no further. Perhaps the manufacturers are rethinking the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and do it better. :\
a real drone
I'm thrilled by the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies with it. Inside, the very good ones fly and the 5 min. Flight time is usually completely enough. The hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly I didn't expect otherwise at the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, no matter whether tiles or carpet, aren't a problem. For questions of nice contact.
Play ok but only with coercion to Steam. Didn't see when buying that it's not a game CD but just a code to download the game. That would be fine, though, but you're forced to install Steam to be able to play it at all, which is an inshame. Since then, the computer has been hanging up constantly, which would certainly not be the case with a purely installation of the game.
Unfortunately, the battery life fails
I was very happy with the clock. Design and optics great, news etc were easily displayed. Operation folded well.... and yet I send them back. Drr big hooks: the battery and its runtime. Loaded in the evenings, located overnight only on drm cabinet and in the morning 11% less battery in case of non-use. Come on the day a lot of news, the battery was at the end at midday/early afternoon and then you can't even read the time. Therefore, for, not usable. Very bad.
Noble case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, it's absolutely worth adding a case. Like the Galaxy Buds - so you can only charge if the case is off. Otherwise, it's really chic and well processed !
High-quality case with tank glass foil
Robust case mt a proper tank glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers an all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be raised easily. The material is pleasant in hand and doesn't pollute. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good value for money. This case gives the phone some hold. It's not too bulky and firmly on the phone. Overall, a good purchase.
