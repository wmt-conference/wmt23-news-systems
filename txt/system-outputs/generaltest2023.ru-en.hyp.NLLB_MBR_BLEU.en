The July issue is traditionally given out during the Moscow Film Festival, and that is, of course, very sad: subtract lines when the soul is ripped for Shabrool.
Nevertheless, we will talk about the MMFF next time (for the moment, I regret that this year the inexplicable idea has finally established itself in the minds of the organisers that happy holders of bought tickets are many times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world breaches), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and on "Kinoweirt".
The cover of the July issue features yet another pleasant face - the title character of Robert Rodriguez's film The Predators, and inside the magazine, be sure not to miss a story about The Beginning by Christopher Nolan (the man, by the way, who reset Batman...), the most eagerly awaited movie of the summer.
And also this time we publish the first part of a rather detailed guide about the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and there is absolutely nothing to advertise, and it is clear that the author of "The Suspicion" and "Rope" is our Tatyana Aleshcheva, Boris Glazerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondury, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kushnov, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mezenov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Piersh, Aleksey Prosnikov, Serafym Szybuki, Adam Smith, Mleba Sole, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelikov, Richard Strelilich, Richard Ol'shchenko, Eli Mann, Eli Mann, Eli Mann, who decided to follow the list of the Russian spies and that was created in favor of the former spy Shahrukh Solzhenitski.
Pushed into a corner, she'll paint herself black and go off on her own quest for the truth.
Another fighter with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fateful boyband promises to further consolidate the position of the actress in the action genre.
She'll set up one car crash after another, run through the walls like a "Matrix" and throw down like children strong men in the same strict suits.
That's kind of how beauty is supposed to save the world.
There he is, the native who blew up and fixed the world with the Fifth Element and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis, he was the most superheroic guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of evil.
And it all turned out to be, not a boring American blockbuster about saving humanity, but a living, sweet carnival.
What Besson did for 13 years between The Element... and Adele... I don't want to remember.
He was busy, to say the least, but all that script-producer hubbub and those rare, exhausting directorial appearances, they will be forgotten.
And then there's Adele... not really.
When you see the movie, it feels like 13 years ago, Besson wasn't our Besson, but a double.
And he, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drinking wine in the café across the street and writing a story about the most charismatic adventurer.
To retell the plot (albeit in its general features), to heat expectations in this case is more sinful than usual.
The whole incredible drive here is that behind every turn or every line there's a surprise waiting for you.
And all of them pleasant.
Is it a girl or a vision
The unusual involvement of the court.
The worst adventure movie of the decade has hinted that "The Incredible Adventures of Adele" will begin as "Amelia", move on to "Jurassic Park", continue "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comics about journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin only appeared in three films before Adele.
She became famous for her role in The Girl from Monaco, for which she was nominated for the César Award.
The filmmaker does not follow the audience, the hands raised, begging them to appreciate special effects, sets, or tricks, but he leads them like an old-fashioned novelist, exclaiming before the great journey to the center of the earth or to the edge of the world: "Come, my reader, great things await us!
At the same time, Besson deals with genre cinema, which he knows absolutely everything about, lightly and fun, like a boy who has seen old films and read a lot of Jules Verne.
Manipulating banality, not shying away from cynicism and not being afraid to take risks.
Directed by Luc Besson.
This is the end of the world.
SUMMARY: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.
The city was terrorized by an ancient monster, brought back to life by an old medium.
The excavated creature is being pursued by the police as well as a famous hunter, a pair of scientists from the Natural History Museum, and journalist Adèle Blan-Sec, who has a case not so much with the monster itself as with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl smuggles a real mummy out of Egypt.
[ Man ] I want you to go.
Adele...  the case where the parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre and is able to radically change it by sending it in a new direction.
So it was with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with the gangster fighters Quentin Tarantino, the above-mentioned "Indiana Jones" (who was both admired and ridiculed), and finally with the same "Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this film is made of verbal trickery, comedic clownry, and story-driven balancing (circus terms are quite appropriate - the union of the two arts is organic and stronger here than ever).
I need to say a few words about Adele herself.
She has become an undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer who takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality, but the sheer courage and courage.
In the movies, they usually have a macho on duty or a romantic with a big head
I just want to say...
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical sighing creature that is turning under your feet (only its knowledge of zoology is useful).
So the energetic girl doesn't waste time on amorous trifles but has a fun time in the company of ancient corpses, who, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained in numerous genre "cats", and seemingly out-of-the-box, Luc Besson showed an unexpected creative flair by reminding the audience that the line between the preferences of the boring megamoll-goers and the tall-talking art house-goers is easily crossed by films for the buoyant madmen.
A game of adventure film without sadness, fear and blame
The room of death.
A hermetic horror with a claim to psychology and political context in 2002, Jonathan Libesman's horror debut was slammed by critics, but it was liked by the public and made a good profit at the box office, and most importantly - caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director came to a factory forging new horror by old legals: Bay set out to remake all the classics of horror and gave Libesman the adaptation of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
The critique was again curved, but the audience liked it again  Libesman worked in the spirit of the new horrors, which emphasized the excessive physiology of violence.
In fact, you can see his example as an entire genre in a convulsive trance, trying to invent new ways to reach a saturated audience: the naturalistic blood of the Splatters merges with the pursuits of the slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the Cabbage Patch franchise, but without the blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincenzo Natali's debut painting The Cube, made by Michael Bay.
So, in "The Death Room", Libesman was forced to take a different route: stupid slaughters, or a monotonous run-away from a maniac, he preferred the more intelligent option - almost without the notorious bloodshed, but with psychological games and puzzles.
The evil doctors here are playing cat and mouse with their subjects.
And three men in a locked room trying to work out a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and take orders from outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
But not only the test, the test of an ambitious young intelligence officer is being tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who has been trained in wild experiments.
SUMMARY: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given a pile of paper with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat walks into the room posing as a doctor, and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, with government agents closely observed from behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for a horror film, but not enough for a candid art house.
He can have a casual conversation and a fire extinguisher on his face, but he can't miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the other hand, is careful and adamant in her sympathies.
Wounded by her father's courteous lifestyle, she watches frantically as he dives into the pool for another romantic victim, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Die Show.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young lover from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not the difference between the generations or the choice of profession, it is already predetermined, but the girl's unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
The dull melodramatic Mger Mkrtchan together with Pavel Bardin made a comedy with Ivan Urgant "Troy and the snowflake".
The father of a teenage daughter in the genre of comedy convincingly portrayed Depardieu
The plot revolves around the love affairs of the characters, who all the time talk about psychology, and themselves, apparently due to the witty director's invention, emphasize the language of glance and gesture.
The secondary plot branches (the girl injured in the car accident, whom Alexey wants to marry, the sportsman-alchas in the performance of Sergei Gorobchenko), unfortunately, are only dotted.
Especially the line about the football buyback business, and the one that was left behind.
SUMMARY: The biggest concern for a soccer star's agent in the world is his teenage daughter, Nasty.
His own heartbroken father changes girls like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn 18, and she definitely wants to marry a guy with a big head.
What a disappointment for a businessman when Nastya, in the fight for independence and in the peak of his father, chooses his peer and business partner.
With its potential catchphrase for the film's audience, the author is number nine: "Don't look for a problem where there isn't one".
The resemblance is striking.
Both films feature a team of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who set them up, and in each company one beautiful girl.
They land in the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and they exploit the same highlights - and there and there an item filled with dollar bills explodes and a whirlwind of dollars descends on the set.
Even the villains, dressed in expensive costumes, are hard to tell apart (played by Patrick  Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Previously on Avatar, Zoe Saldana played Neytiri.
Sylvain White used to do a dance battle movie called The Dance Brotherhood.
Chris Evans was recently asked to play a character from another comic book, Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by the comic book series that came out in the 70s and was rebooted in the 2000s, and Joe Carnahan was inspired by the comic series from the 80s.
It's just amazing how they, without getting along, have brought different material to an absolutely identical roaring denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessarily brawling movies that recall a lot of pictures of Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably fall in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If there is a choice between these two films, Losers looks a little bit more likeable and clearly victorious from the point of view of the CPI (although the budget is three and a half times smaller).
Well, at least we have Zoe Saldana, who's a real bazooka.
The other three are Jeff Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, and Columbus Short.
Summary: During a sting operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of CIA Mother Commandos set their superiors up: The helicopter with the children they were trying to rescue is blown up, and the soldiers themselves are presumed dead.
But they are alive and willing to do whatever it takes to get revenge on the dark-voiced villain who caused this.
All that's nice, but honestly, spending an hour and a half of your life on a White painting is only worth it if you have absolutely nothing to be more enthusiastic about.
Made from recycled material, a conditionally edible food processor
The simple story of an escaped Romanian prisoner
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at the prestigious international film festival.
Basically, having these data in hand, you can visualize both the hypothetical content of the painting and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, cinema promises to be highly social.
Certainly it will be realistic, and hard.
High probability of involvement of amateur actors.
Also there will be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty doesn't know nationality, but Romanian, as our film festival winners prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, you can easily take what happens on screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries who were lectured about Bresso in the early 80s.
The film won the Grand Prix of the jury at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andreea Valean, whose work is in great demand among the directors of the Romanian "New Wave".
Operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
What we said is also valid for Florin Cerban's debut work, and - understand us correctly - is not insulting, but a recommendation: the Romanian 'new wave' is at that blessed stage of development when the faith of its representatives in the methods
I haven't lost my job yet.
And this is a moment to be captured: it is only through this faith that you can endure the spectacle of an hour and a half of a Romanian penal colony and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pistrean (whose story, despite the gap between the two cultures, is easy to follow)
...in the 1970s, with a cowboy who decided to walk from the jail he'd been forced to get out of to the nearest saloon.
The role of the female lead of the movie is played by George Pitreanu, Ada Condescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
SYNOPSIS: After four years in prison, 18-year-old Zack Silviu (Pistereanu) is about to be freed but unexpectedly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this point on, the young man's behavior becomes inappropriate.
The affair with the social worker Anna further instigates the boy to desperate acts, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the painting.
What nonsense!
You want to watch, watch.
A good debut, and a glimmer of hope that the Romanian art house could grow into a decent brand one day.
A cartoon about the joys of crime and family life.
The directorial debut of Grubb (Sop) and his co-writer Renault is made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, a gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all Ice Age, Horton and Robots.
The Ugly I is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully painted (by the way, it makes sense to see in the zoo), especially if you like it when different objects are tempted to jump from the screen into the hall), it is well written, and most importantly, there are no jokes below the waist that in the Ice Age made you shame yourself in a chair and close the children's ears with your hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the author's sense of measure, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn was dictated by the reluctance to touch the subject of pedophilia in any way.
The "adult" part here, in addition to the basic conflict of single-parenting, is pretty hardcore black humor (which I'd like to think we owe to director Coffin).
All in all, it's a very nice movie, so much so that at some point it's even too perfect and right.
You can feel the hard work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought of every detail to make the film appeal to all categories of citizens.
Not that we want to see cartoon characters eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic blast.
Plot: The evil bear Gru, whose childhood dreams of space travel have evolved over the years into the idea of stealing the moon, is forced to enlist the help of young children to carry out his grand scheme to eliminate a young rival.
In an upscale orphanage, he adopts three orphaned girls: Margo in glasses, Edith in a hat, and Agnes, who can only be compared to the cat from Shreck.
As is usually the case, the children overturn the plans of the adults.
The main character is drawn with Christopher Melodendry - both are bald, nosey, and prone to dark humor.
The original characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Siegel.
In the final, Grew dances the part of Travolta.
A wagon pulls up to an abandoned trailer in the middle of a makeshift desert, and from the wagon emerges three pairs of the nicest tits.
Just like that.
In themselves, the bearers of this gift are not essential.
The camera is definitely focusing on this part of the body.
For the fans here in this world, the good news is that the entire film is in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most important things about a woman's beauty, and he cast it in such a way that what happens on the screen is secondary.
And a lot of fun stuff going on.
The Broker, the Killer, and the Stripper dig in the sand, get splashed with water (don't ask why), carry a purge, and occasionally fight quite violently.
The creators think a mothering calf with graceful features, smeared in mud, a broken nose and glittering whitish teeth is cool.
"Too Bitchy Stuff" is primarily focused on classic sex tape.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of Xena: Warrior Queen and The Wonderful Adventures of Hercules.
This is the spirit of the movie at the Moscow box office. "A thorn for Jennifer".
It's even more awesome when a bitchy beauty is making balls out of a bandit, the punk asshole is paired up with a Japanese schoolgirl, and there's samurai sword and lesbian sex, and the intrigue is piled up by endless flashbacks.
In short, for a film fetishist, this is a real Klondike of pleasure.
Now, I know that Jacobson and his gang had a lot of fun making this thrash parody, but the task itself feels pretty bizarre.
If it wasn't for the physical actress, it would be boring by the middle.
It's safe to assume that this ferocity came to us from the Adult Swim network (Jacobson, by the way, frequently appears on the network)
This is the first movie that's made in the last ten years.
Three dangerous beauties lead a mafia boss into the desert with a cache of diamonds somewhere in this valley.
With no luck and after shooting the hapless bandit, the women begin to fight with each other and the regularly arriving jerks, as well as regularly kissing and snuggling.
As the case progresses it becomes clear that all three are not who they were thought to be.
I guess the author thinks it's more fun that way.
A product for the narrow circle of monstrous fools
Yeah, with his latest painting "Judgment Day", stripped down as "Mad Max" for the poor, Marshall made a serious dent in his
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum restores the director's shaken confidence.
The new, unpolitical, and grim magnum opus doesn't shy away from a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and fierce aesthetics of the B category.
It's got both the hooligan courage of "Warrior Dogs" and the brutal brutality of "Departure".
Marshall's plan to cleanse the peplum of the post-gladiator filth has largely worked.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His combat-scarred legionnaires (among them the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are stern men trying to marry their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
The murder and the piquant details of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which has taken a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by the opening in the German forests of the now-standard "Gladiator" Sir Ridley Scott, but to try to accuse Marshall of plagiarism for some reason is absolutely unnecessary: he works honestly and without pretense.
The show is based on the best-selling book by Dr. Seuss, with the screenplay by Michael Fassbender, Olga Kuriilenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, and David Morrissey.
COVER: The lands of modern Scotland occupied by the Holy Roman Empire
The remote outpost where the centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is stationed is ruthlessly destroyed by the Picts' scouting force.
Miraculously saved, Dias is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a handful of other surviving Romans, try to elude a group of Pictish militants led by the sadist Itay (Kurilenko).
The thin arthouse actor has so far managed to win back only secondary roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after "Centurion" the situation will change.
Peplum - edition corrected and supplemented.
Almost like Gladiator, only more humble and severe.
A continuation of the story of high schooler Belle (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two extremely promising young men  the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-cultivator Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A full-blown movie version of the animated series about a bald wizard boy sent to bring peace to the four realms.
The Fire Lord has waged a bloody war and subdued his neighbors.
Young Aang can only stop him if he learns to control all the elements and become the Avatar.
House Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a master mind-stealer and a tireless worker in the field of industrial espionage.
By infiltrating the subject's sleep, it forces the sleeping brain to work according to its own rules.
But this time he will have to do the opposite - leave something in one head that wasn't there.
A colorful lesson in how to control illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
A skilled wizard (Nicholas Cage) finds a young assistant in hopes of defeating an evil wizard (Alfred Molina).
With destructive spells, they'll create a plague of dragons and explosions in the middle of Manhattan.
Bald as a billiard ball, the cat has conspired to take over the world, and now the super-dog agents are forced to join forces with their meowing adversaries.

A few rogue vigilantes, led by the sly-looking Royce (Adrien Brody), find themselves mysteriously stranded on another planet, where they are being sport hunted by stylish, fanged aliens.
The return of an iconic '80s character to the big screen.
Consider George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer turned filmmaker Anton Corbijn for a very interesting existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding out from the public in a small Italian town, and slowly coming to terms with human nature.
"A visionary artist on the scale of Corbin and the magnificent George Clooney are a cinematic union sealed in heaven", boasts the studio's press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love affair in Clooney's life - with Italy: the filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel The Very Stealthy Gentleman, Rowan Joffe made some changes to the script: the title character was replaced by an American, and the hero became a murderer.
The rest of the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack tries to deal with his latest case and finally quit his lucrative craft, his icy heart melts under the charm of the local priest (Paolo Bonachelli) and the street prostitute (Tekla Rutten), whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love with.
"Jack is tempting fate", says the official synopsis.
The dangerous messenger of darkness gets closer and closer, and the mysterious lady who employs him may not be who she says she is.
Judging by the trailer, Korbyn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ash chevron (the film is similar to the long clip 02), have gone to a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will star in the film adaptation of On the Western Front Unchanged
Can I shoot you with my camera gun?
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at once this season.
First, in Venice, on the set of the thriller The Tourist by Florian Henkel von Donnersmark.
There he plays the tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's character.
Second, in Puerto Rico at the Roman Diary, the film adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The project is directed and written by Bruce Robinson (Whittle and I), whose last directorial work was the 1992 thriller Jennifer 8.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of the national prison drama, you can not doubt what inspired them.
But you can't take the implementation of an idea literally!
However, it is good at least that the heroine of the Russian painting is foreign, but not bald.
Director Dennis Dugan specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They have produced four projects together: Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, Chuck and Larry: The Fire Wedding, and Don't Mess With Gohan.

Tom Tykwer is adapting the fantasy novel The Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell.
According to the director, this is not easy (the novel has six parallel storylines), but extremely interesting work.
He has already made offers to Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McEvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
In Crimea, shooting of international fighter Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title "Soldiers of Luck" is taking place.
It's about millionaires who went to war for their own money in search of adrenaline.

The film is scheduled for release in early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the new comedy Baby Jesus alongside English pop star Pixie Lott.
Megan Fox was fired from Transformers 3.
Film company Ragatoipe assures, the firing is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler.
However, the role of the main character and new lover of the protagonist Shay LaBaf will most likely be taken by English model Rosie Huntington-Whitley.
The girl has no film experience, so she will have accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not scare the sophisticated viewer - there are a lot of examples in the history of cinema of successful transplants of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ( Monster), Angelina Jolie ( Interrupted Life), Jessica Lang ( Blue Skies,  Tutsi), Kim Basinger ( Secrets of Los Angeles), Jennifer Connelly ( Mind Games), Gina Davis ( Random Tourist) and  First Vice-Miss USA-86 Halle Berry ( Ball of Monsters) started as a model or modelling for fashion magazines, eventually going on to win an honorary  Oscar.
Success in acting (also the beauties Milla Yovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Belucci and, which is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurilenko.
High rewards are clearly within reach.
In short, Rosie has someone to look up to.
Valeria Guy Germanica, who received the Special Mention of the Cannes Jury in 2008 for her picture "Everyone will die, but I will stay" and made the scandalous TV series "School", became a creative director at the TV channel MT.
The channel believes that it is Valerie who will be able to bring about the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to shoot their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germania has also started casting new hosts.
The comedy "Colotis" directed by Leo Gabriadze and produced by Timur Bekmambetov suddenly turned into a "Bullshit".
The main theme of the film has remained the same: provincial Russian language teacher Slava Kolotilov (Kostantine Khabensky) rushes to Moscow to his fiancée, but is delayed to coach the football team of the homeless.
The second plot line of the picture received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaxina, the role of the capital bride Nadia will be played by Milla Jovovich.
As additional intrigue, there will be a third , former fiancé of Nadia Dane (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, apart from the question of whether the home team will win the football championship, a dilemma arises as to who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in production of The Hobbit and the availability of a large number of other projects, Guillermo del Toro has declined the position of director.
The studios are persuading producer Peter Jackson to take matters into his own hands, but he is only willing to make that move in case of urgent need.
The potential successors are David Yeats, who has completed shooting the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, was nominated for an Oscar.
The official name of the new director will be announced at the next Soots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie is going to play Cleopatra.
Stunned by the tight schedule, critics and cinematographers were speeding between the Winter Theater in Sochi, where shows with master classes were held, and the "Pearl Hotel", where there were press conferences and round tables, barely managing to dive into the Black Sea.
The characters of the competing films were also under the article - almost everyone ran somewhere: confused Asians from "Gastharbytera" Yusup Razykova and "Other heaven" Dmitry Mamuliya searched for the missing grandson and wife, the fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's painting "To live"
Those same cops were happily surrounded by detective Klim Šipenko's character Who am I? who, however, was remembered by the audience more by the presence in the frame of the totally naked Jeanne Friske.
Heroes of the domestic show business also appeared in a couple of competition pictures - in the film "Slon" Sergei Shnurov played a trucker carrying a circus animal to the slaughter, and Evgeny Hryshkovets spoke on favorite topics - female treachery, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the two-person film "Satisfaction", where business partners called each other for an alkoduel because of a woman.
However, the business events at "Cinematheque" had a noticeable impact on the show - it was not boring at any of them.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of the Russian arthouse, the chairman of the fund for support of Russian cinema, Sergey Tolstykov, had a painterly quarrel with critics: "Do you read the articles in the press that I read?" - he asked the gathered menacingly.
"I write them", the president of the YERVEZ, Andrey Plakhov, replied confused.
The scandals did not end there: closer to the end of the festival, the film of Alexei Fedorchenko, "Osijanki", was abruptly removed from the competition program - he will go to Venice: the selectors of the Mostra decided that the excessive Russian showing would interfere with them.
Previously, "Kinotavr" did not interfere with the giants - films of big festivals were shown in Sochi many times: this time, for example, Sergei Loznica's film "My Happiness" participated in the competition, which competed with Mikhalkov and Virasetakun on the Azure Beret in the spring.
Nikita Sergeyevich on Kinotavr visited the film of the former Cannes competitor and stated that he liked it.
Chairman of the jury Karen Shahnazarov, on the contrary, did not like the painting Loznitsa, but under pressure from colleagues, he was forced to give it a prize for directing.
The award for best debut   Missing   went to his daughter.

The flawlessly dressed and shaven programmer Leonid reacts to the world with a restrained cavalier, hiding in the den of a neat bachelor lifestyle.
But the iron woman descends on the house, the unjust hand of the punitive bodies is on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's useful to work with more than just debutants", producer Sabina Eremeeva stated triumphantly from the stage, taking away the prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull an "internal debutante" out of the corridor of domestic art-cinema.
And it is symptomatic that in our cinema today, the elves are going after the youth.
Not the other way around.
A documentary shot in a way that is more head-scratching than a similar feature film.
The author is interested in a screwdriver exploring an electric counter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting on a cast iron pan - all of which turns the story about an unemployed miner, his rare-toothed sweetheart and her criminal brother into a real canvas.
The winner of the short metre competition, Nikolay Sokolov, is trying out the black and white French new wave style on the world of sleeping areas.

For 10 years, we've been working on a remake of the sci-fi movie starring Michael York.
Recently, Karl Rinsch was appointed director (he already has a remake of "The Creature from the Black Lagoon") famous for his advertising clips.
Previously, it had been associated with the names of Brian Singer (X People), James McTig (V means vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy).
The hero, who turned thirty, is forced to flee from the death penalty, because the society of the future executes all citizens at that age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to a '80s rotoscopic fantasy cartoon and plans to make it into a major motion picture.
The original was a collaboration between director Ralph Bakshi (m/f The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and lots of painted boobs.
In it, warrior Larn saves Princess Tigru and all the people from the evil ice lord Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to pay careful attention to the creation of Inhumans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will be putting his zombies on a vacation soon as he plans to make a remake of Dario Argento's classic Jallo movie.
Bringing the action back to the big screen is none other than Michael Bay, master of action, explosion, and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damien Chen, who will adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had previously collaborated on "Day of the Dead" and "Two Evil Eyes" together in 1990.
This time, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing and writing the screenplay.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will be joining Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy Arthur.
"I wanted to bring more power to the female character to reflect the state of affairs in China", Chen says.
Chinese women are now running big businesses and winning Olympic gold medals.
Gong Li is the embodiment of that power.
This is the second time in a row you've played a fictional character.
Is that a coincidence?
The pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I represented here (at the CineTavre and the Sochi Film Market - EMRBE) two paintings.
And I play the dream woman in both.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he introduced me, and that's what a lot of people think that I am in real life.
The dream girl.
Your partner in the film, Alexander Yatsenko, is nothing like his character.
How did you find common ground?
He's not at all what he seems at first glance.
At first, I saw it and I thought, "Yeah... it's not like I had to".
I guess without the human connection, the sincere and genuine, we wouldn't have gotten anywhere.
And that contact was just a few minutes after we met.
We're great, I'm not afraid of that word, we're friends.
I told him all my fears, all my anxieties, and all my fears of not being able to do it, and I asked him for some advice and help, and he was happy to give that advice and that help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was so afraid of losing this connection, of losing our understanding.
So, at the premiere, we watched the whole movie holding hands.
How was the filming in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I came to for the first time.
I've never toured there, never been there on vacation, never been there as a kid.
This town has a kind of magic, its own character, its own charisma.
And this is the city I want to come back to.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and everyone is always on time.
So it wasn't hard for you to be in love with this city.
In fact, you are very organic on screen, which is something a lot of people, frankly, weren't expecting.
How do you work with roles?
Do you find emotional scenes easy?
You know, I'm not a professional actor.
And I'm a very trusting person by nature.
If I go and I agree to work with a director, I'm actually putting myself in his hands and I want to be the dough to be made.
I am aware that this is a very visible situation, and so I ask for the instructions and I talk to the director for a long time, and I'm not even talking to him, but he's having pre-conversations with me and explains very clearly and very exactly what he wants.
And then after hours and hours and hours of rehearsal, we arrive at this organic you're talking about.
And how was it working with the director, Klim Shipenko?
I got high from everyone, the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I love working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was prepared to go without sleep, without food, and this was exactly the situation.
No sleep, no food for days on end - no matter if it's thunder or hail.
And if something doesn't work - it was a disaster, and something urgent must be done to make it work.
It's very easy to work in this atmosphere of madness.
And it seems to me that when people are so driven to a sick fanaticism of what they're doing, it can't go wrong because it takes too much energy.
What scenarios are you refusing?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you are going to work with?
I don't want any silly dialogues, movies that say nothing, that mean nothing.
I don't want to work just to show up on the screen.
Do you have any suggestions, any projects you want to work on in the near future?
There are no concrete proposals or plans at this time.
I'm not the kind of person who writes charts.
The script came in, I got interested, there was this premiere today.

And the interesting thing is that half the people you know constantly talk about who should be boycotted and who should be supported, for some -- sorry, very vague reasons.
And yet, when one of these festivals closes with a horror-looking Chu4 film with no English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
It's the last thing you want to think about, but if you buy a ticket, and if you stay in the theater to stare at the giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors, they're going to show you.
But we have no pixels on the screen: Tron: Legacy, the sequel to the classic VR film, Let Me In, the saga, the American remake of a wonderful Swedish movie, Uncontrollable, another take on trains by Tony Scott, and a wildly detailed account of how Conan, the Barbarian, the Destroyer and the Governor are made.

So the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwarts will stretch into next summer.
The social network.
The history of the creation of Facebook
David Fincher's new film is first and foremost a story of paradox.
The story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering internet tools that connected the world, tore off five friends, and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire in decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is as brilliant as our conflict genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg started the website for a number of reasons: partly out of anger about the world around him, partly because of his sporting interest, and partly simply because it's "cool".
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a precise calculation and a considered business plan.
The strengths of the "social network" are apparent from the first shots, especially in the scene before the opening subtitles, where Zuckerberg is talking to his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara) for less than five minutes in a bar: the loud, tough dialogue of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gains strength here and does not soften until the very end.
The same with Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (except for the Winklevoss twins played by completely different actors).
The face of one of them was computer-graphically imposed on the other.
Natalie Portman was at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara got the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
Directed by David Fincher.
♪ It's all right, baby ♪ ♪ You're the only one ♪ ♪ I want you to have a great night
Storyline: Grumpy and reclusive Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, after getting his personal life turned around, embarks on the ambitious task of creating a completely new social network.
As Facebook grows in popularity, relationships with a few friends-of-companions begin to deteriorate, eventually leading to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its part: warm, sunny in places, cozy even in the dark, it maneuvers between two confusing chains of events and two separate legal wrangling.
Beyond the continuous flow of debate, there isn't much happening in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal fuss is unlikely to add a paragraph of context to his meager Wikipedia page.
So what attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this not-so-generous story?
After the viewing, there is a persistent feeling that "social media" is a portrait of our time, and that the understatement is an important artistic technique.
Just over twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing much the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big cases.
Now that daily payments are even higher, policy is no longer carried out in board meetings or in the sand bowl.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, wants to be the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevoss (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are kicking around: Who says rich, beautiful and athletic can't also be smart?
(This line is especially amusing to Fincher.)
Social media could be turned into a black comedy if you wanted to.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what's more in it, positive or negative?
And what are the social implications of this invention?
Is he a con man?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin would never close a book if there was even the slightest hint of that.
But here, they won't even need to - in their version of history, it doesn't matter.
"What does it feel like to feel beautiful?" asks the song Tre VeaNez Vabu Wozte A Vsp Map, which introduces the song's title.
The hero doesn't know.
The film provides the answer.
Zuckerberg is part of a lost online generation that has little concept of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tastefully crafted character drama about a high-profile court case of the internet era.
At the beginning of the XVII century, when Ivan Susanin lived, the surnames of people of insignificant origin had not yet begun to appear.
We were called "the son of so-and-so".
So there were patronymics going on - nicknames for the father.
But sometimes, such as in the case of a father's remarriage, the matronym was used - a nickname for the mother's name.
Susanin is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susannah".
The serfs of the small landowners really did go without names for a long time - what is it for, when you have 20 souls and everything is always in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the fortress princes of Andrew of Cherkash already at the beginning of the XVIII century had surnames all together.
In the 19th century, even small landowners did not keep the man on the land, but let him go on the brink - let him earn his craft and pay the master.
A peasant had to have a passport with his name on it.
With the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released on parole.
It means they already had last names.
Capital criminologists have arrived to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Central Crime Bureau officers and judicial experts have arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the gas explosion in a house on Linear, 39, according to the NSC.
According to the investigation, the defendants, Irina Urbach and Evgeniy Kavun, posing as employees of the fictional organization "Mejregiongaz", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used substandard parts, were sloppy, and charged prices for their services, the agency said, citing a source with knowledge of the situation.
On the eve of the tragedy on the Line, a man and a woman visited three apartments in the house No. 39, where they were changing the hose plates.
For example, in one of the apartments, they replaced the gas hose with a water hose.
Cavon, however, denies this.
He says it's impossible, everything was certified.
Their actions caused a leak and explosion of a gas-air mixture in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, killing 13 people.
Earlier suspects were arrested in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg managed to avoid a sudden flood
Arguments of the Week.
Saint Petersburg → The company
February 11, 2023, 15:12 Elena Sokolova was born in Russia

The flooding was prevented by the closure of the dam a day earlier.
On Friday, the threat of flooding increased sharply in St. Petersburg due to bad weather in the city.
A sea flood was prevented by the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd, according to the St. Petersburg edition of Neva.Today.
The water level reached 60 inches [184 cm], but thanks to the closure of the locks in the Gulf of Finland, the water was kept at 55 inches [168 cm], just six inches [7.2 cm] above the lower flood threshold of between 60 and 90 inches [161 cm - 210 cm].
Weather conditions were complicated by a gusty wind, whose speed sometimes reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has receded, and ships can again navigate through the Gulf of Finland.
Ten weather stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland are monitoring the water situation.
This prevents flooding that may follow stronger winds.
8 people arrested in Turkey over building collapse
Eight people have been arrested in the Turkish province of Şanlıurfa in connection with construction defects found in buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
According to Armenpress, this is reported by Habertürk.
The earthquake in Turkey on February 6 killed more than 20 thousand people.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7-magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks that were felt not only in 10 provinces in Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sends congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader and President of Iran
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has sent congratulatory messages to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Seyed Ali Khamenei and the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ibrahim Raisi on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
This was reported to Armenpress by the Department of Information and Public Relations of the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia.
The message to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution of Iran, Seyed Ali Khamenei, reads:
"Your Highness,
I congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The Armenian-Iranian warm and friendly relations with centuries-old roots, rich history and traditions have special significance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnessing steady and stable bilateral cooperation.
I am confident that the Armenian-Iranian friendly relations, which were forged in the atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, will have even greater achievements for the benefit of the peoples of Armenia and Iran.
I take this opportunity to wish you good health and long life".
The congratulatory message sent to Ibrahim Raisi, in particular, says: "Your Excellency, accept the heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
The inviolable Armenian-Iranian relations, based on centuries-old history and mutual respect, are of special significance for the Republic of Armenia.
I am confident that as a result of joint efforts, we will be able to bring interstate cooperation to a new level, the multi-sectoral agenda of which will be further expanded for the welfare of our two friendly peoples and the security of our countries.
Stressing the importance of our vision for establishing and strengthening regional peace and stability, I confirm the official invitation to visit Armenia addressed to you during my visit to Tehran last year.

WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
On Friday, a World War II-era bomb was detonated in the British port city of Great Yarmouth, England, as bomb-smugglers were trying to defuse it.
A powerful explosion was heard tens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police have announced that although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military who were defusing the bomb were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after the start of the defuse work.
Fortunately, all personnel are safe.
Authorities are assessing the damage", Assistant Chief Constable Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents posted on social media that the blast shook homes 15 miles away.
The photo was taken by Sky Revolutions.
Photo caption: The explosion was against the plans of the bomb squad, but there were no deaths or injuries
The 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the North Sea, stands the Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the bomb squad built a sand barrier around it and put a 200-meter fence around it, to keep outsiders out.
Explosion engineers had initially planned to use the robot to cut the detonator from the bomb back on Thursday, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, according to local media, to use a technique called "slow burn".
It was the firing that caused the explosion.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
Just during the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from the autumn of 1940 to the spring of 1941, known as the Blitz, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Nearly 40% of Belarusian researchers are women
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, a researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences Alesiya Soloveya told BELTA.
The proportion of women among science candidates and science doctors is also increasing: among science candidates women make up 41.1%, among doctors of science - 21%.
In all fields of science, except technical sciences, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is the medical sciences, in which the proportion of women is 64.4%.
Only in the technical sciences are men predominant, with women making up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the proportion of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is 10.2% more than in the rest of the country.
Among the candidates of science, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of science - 20%.
More than half of the professors in higher education institutions are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, every third is a woman (31,8%), among the deans - 38,7%, deputy deans - 44,6%, and department heads - 42,5%.
Women are the highest number of the senior teachers and teachers - more than 60%.
The proportion of women among the professors is also high (55.2%).
According to a republican public opinion monitoring conducted by the Institute of Sociology at the National Academy of Sciences last year, most Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about the opportunities of women in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree with the gender stereotype that "science is a male area of activity" to some extent.
More than half of the country's inhabitants do not share the opinion that women are less competent as scientists - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation of gender representations about women's research competence in the mass consciousness is helping to attract young women to science, develop their creative potential, and form a successful role model of the woman scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institute of mentorship", said Alena Solowey.
11 February is celebrated annually as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.
The holiday is established to involve women and girls in science, to encourage the development of women's research careers and to recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers worldwide.
The probability of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina after the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep the rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have occurred recently.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have deteriorated markedly - the price of Russian oil has fallen.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is better than the October forecast.
A shift is continuing in demand patterns: consumption remains subdued, private investment is slowing down, but public expenditure is rising.
At the same time, proinflationary risks have generally increased.
"Therefore, this year, the probability of a rate increase is greater than the probability of a rate drop.
The appropriateness of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation", said E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, a rapid increase in consumption with higher inflation expectations if the factors that hold consumption activity back are eased.
Second, there is a growing labor shortage and productivity growth lagging behind wage growth.
And there remain risks of further tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the future decisions of the regulator, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the earlier strengthening of proinflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5 - 7%.
According to her, this may require a higher key rate trajectory than expected in October.
In the Central Bank's updated forecast for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate were raised by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but the likelihood and scale have declined.
On the contrary, the likelihood that some rate increases may be needed to keep inflation close to the target of 4% in 2024 has increased", the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed investment fund (CIF), consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be withdrawn from the existing retail PIFs.
This will enable the management of the remaining liquid assets and resume investment tranches operations.
If the retail fund comprises more than 10% of the blocked securities, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed fund before 1 September 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares in the original fund.
It may also be possible to change the status of the retail fund to a closed fund.
For funds with less than 10% of blocked securities, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the blocked assets into a separate closed-end fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities to a special PEF.
In the case of the sale of such papers, the management companies are obliged to pay the owners of investment shares at least 90% of the proceeds every quarter, according to the announcement of the Bank of Russia.
In addition to the industry, the experts gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Analytical Center and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia the passenger traffic of air transport decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation - by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic was 95.2 million people, and passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger kilometers.
International passenger traffic was 17.2 million, down 26.7% from the previous year, while domestic passenger traffic was 78.0 million (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by state support programs.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was in place, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could get a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rostourism.
Also, several state support programs were implemented to ensure the availability of air transportation, including subsidizing the transportation of citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc. with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and capitalize Aeroflot by 52,5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of state subsidization of the sector (as yet allocated 25.3 billion rubles), in 2023 passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (internal passenger flow will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of Rosaviation, to 103.0 million people", the PSB analysts share the forecasts.
An attack in Jerusalem killed a 6-year-old child
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were killed in a terrorist attack in Jerusalem when a speeding car crashed into a bus stop.
Six other people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot on the spot.
He was later identified as a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions have been classified as a terrorist attack by law enforcement, the terrorist's relatives have been detained, and the house has been sealed.
At the same time, Israeli media reported that the attacker had mental health issues and had only been released from the hospital this week.
Austria is tightening controls on its border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people are staying at the border in cars waiting to cross to the Austrian side.
This thus becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already passed the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on the existing agreements, Austria considers that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those who want to cross the border: many migrants fall victim to smugglers and end up between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
Which is why, according to the police, you need increased surveillance.
Vienna's decision to tighten checks followed a pledge by European Union leaders to devote more funds to security cameras, drones and guard towers to guard the commonwealth's borders.
According to Frontex, last year, the number of illegal migrants arriving in the EU and applying for refugee status exceeded the number in 2016 for the first time, with more than 330,000.
The Progress 83 cargo ship has successfully docked with the ISS.
The Progress 83 automatic refueling spacecraft successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:45 am Greenwich, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred 269 statute miles above the South Pacific Ocean.

How pregnant Russian women are stuck in Argentina
The Argentine migration service has begun suspending and revoking residency permits for Russians who have obtained them after the child is born but did not stay in the country.
Earlier, authorities in the republic denied entry to several pregnant Russian women who were suspected of "birth tourism".
On February 11, they were allowed to enter Argentina by court order.
For more details, see the article on "Gazette.Ru".
Argentina's migration authorities have begun suspending and revoking residence permits for Russians who have obtained them through the birth of their child but who do not stay in the country.
The director of the service, Florence Carignano, told C5N television.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to get a residence permit because their child is Argentinian but spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (country)", she explained.
According to her, when the Argentine citizenship issue is examined in court for the Russian, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because the man "spent a month in Argentina and never came back".
Carignano warned that Russians who receive visas after the birth of a child and then leave could have their permits revoked.
On this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at an airport in Argentina due to the denial of entry into the country.
According to Georgiy Paulin, the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, the diplomatic mission links the incident to the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls at the entrance to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more arrived on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat noted that more pregnant women had flown to Argentina, but that those three were specifically ordered to stay out of the country.
"They weren't allowed into the country in accordance with the immigration law, where one of the reasons for not allowing in the country is providing incomplete, false, distorted information", Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentinian migration service allowed pregnant Russian citizens into the country by court order, lawyer Cristian Rubilar said.
"They were all allowed to enter Argentina an hour ago", he was quoted as saying by TASS.
Rubilar noted that the Migration Service had changed its decision after the court ruling.
It's easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to get a passport.
It allows short-term visits to 171 countries without visas, including EU countries, the UK and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about a "birth tourism boom" in Argentina among Russians.
According to Pauline, in 2022, from 2 thousand to 2.5 thousand citizens of the Russian Federation moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are planning to give birth there.
"In 2023, that number could grow to 10,000", he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that about 10,500 Russian citizens arrived in Argentina in 2022, and in recent months - more than 5,800 pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how the prices for renting housing in Petersburg changed.
It's down 10%.
At the same time, it is known that throughout the country, rent has become more expensive by 25%, reports the Petersburg Patrol with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
The single room cost 25,000 rubles a month, the studio - 22,000 rubles a month, and the two-room - 36,000 rubles a month.
Experts believe that this may change as early as the spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for questioning women in a foreign country became known.
Argentina's immigration department denied entry to six pregnant Russian women because the purpose of their visit was false.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the television channel Todo Noticias.
For five hours, the pregnant women were asked about the purpose of their visit.
Most of them confessed that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
Because of this, the representatives of the country did not let Russian women into Argentina.
The publication states that the migration service has a procedure if there are suspicions about "fake" travelers.
For example, if a woman is 33 weeks pregnant, has no return ticket to Russia, and can't say where she plans to go on vacation, she will be immediately suspected by the immigration service.
Moreover, experts say that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions".
The actor's decision to leave the theater was planned.

Filippenko noted that the management went to the meeting and prepared all the documents.
For example, he assures us that he "has not let anyone down".
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko is going to undergo "long-term treatment" in a foreign country.
As stated in the publication, the film actor is now working as a guest actor in the Moscow theater.

Kirkorov won the fisherman's case.
In the lawsuit, the man claims that the artist's construction was illegal, but he did not appear at the hearing.
The fisherman was suing the music artist Philip Kirkorov for allegedly illegally installing a pier on his Moscow dacha.
It's on Channel 5.
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
According to the lawyer, the court submitted documents, design projects, which confirmed the legality of all the structures installed on the territory of the house of the celebrity.
According to the head of the law firm, Alexander Dobrovinsky, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff any chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was filed on January 11.
A star lawyer joked that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the artist's house.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky said that he would ask Kirkorov to give the plaintiff his balcony for fishing.
He stressed that from there there's a chance for spinning to go further.
Somnologist named the causes of sleep problems
Doctor-sleep specialist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about the foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
The specialist noted that sleep problems are often caused by foods that contain caffeine.
This primarily applies to tea, coffee, chocolate, and any dessert containing cocoa.
They should be limited before bedtime, because they not only interfere with the ability to fall asleep but also make the sleep "broken", preventing the body from fully recovering.
According to the doctor, it is best to stop consuming caffeinated foods six to eight hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they lower the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and as a result, they can have trouble falling asleep.
Alcohol also affects your ability to sleep.
He says that small amounts of alcohol promote relaxation and do not interfere with sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as shallow sleep and frequent night awakenings.
Also, to prevent sleep problems, somnologists recommend that you avoid eating large portions of spicy foods.
Eating large amounts of spicy foods can raise internal body temperature, which negatively affects your ability to fall asleep.
For a healthy sleep, not only is the outdoor temperature regime required: the ideal is between 18 and 20 degrees - but also the absence of body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, you should not abuse heavy food before sleeping because it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that lack of sound sleep and accumulated sleep deprivation affects the quality of life and habitual activities, so it is essential to follow a sleep and rest regime and allow the body to recover.

According to the agency, the former president's main competitor in the upcoming election will be Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
Republican Desantis has not yet announced his intent to run for president, but sources at Bloomberg say he is already preparing for the primaries.

Donald Trump formally announced his intention to run for president "to make America great again"... during a speech to supporters in Florida.
The current President Joe Biden, despite his team's assurances of his intention to participate in the 60th presidential elections, has stated that he has no firm decision on this issue.
Hundreds of demonstrations against the pension reform in France on Saturday
A fourth day of mass protests against the pension reform is being held by French trade unions on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, according to French media.
After a slight decrease in the number of protesters on Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization", the trade unions hope to bring more demonstrators to the streets this time around, taking into account those citizens who didn't have the opportunity to participate in demonstrations on weekdays.

The next mass protests are scheduled for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, the French Prime Minister Elizabeth Bourne presented a draft pension reform drafted by the government, which envisages increasing the retirement age from 62 to 64.
It is estimated that the retirement age will be gradually moved from 62 to 64, three months per year, until 2030.
The new regime will apply, starting with the generation of French citizens born in September 1961 or after.

Progress MS-21 has been decommissioned at the ISS: February 12, 2023, 00:12
TASS - Kazinform - Roscosmos has announced the launch of Progress MS-21 from the International Space Station, reports MIA "Kazinform" with reference to TASS.
"The contour of the transport cargo ship "Progress MS-21", which was scheduled to sink on February 18, has been disembarked, confirmed by data from the telemetry received by the Central Unified Control Unit", - said in the press service of Roscosmos.
As noted, it is currently isolated from the rest of the station.
The causes of the incident are being determined, it did not affect either the docking of the cargo ship "Progress MS-22", or the further flight program of the ISS.
The situation was commented by the executive director of Roscosmos on manned space programs, Sergei Krykalev.
"The freighter, which has been docked at the station for several months, has experienced a heat leak from the thermostat.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened with our ship (The Union MS-22) in mid-December", he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the Soyuz incident came to the conclusion that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will perform analysis to make sure there are no problems with the next launch.
"We need to do a thorough analysis to make sure that this reason does not extend to designs like this in future launches.
This is the most important task that will face us now", he said.
According to the executive director, there is an analysis to be done in terms of the preparation of the ship for the launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was performed in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22.
"The most important thing is to make sure it's not some systematic mistake", Krikalev added.
The executive director said that a committee has started its work on Saturday to analyze all possible causes.
"The ship was supposed to disconnect and descend from orbit two days before the launch of the ship "Soyuz" ("Soyuz MS-23" - TASS note), so there are serious consequences for the actions of the crew, for the work of the crew... From this point of view, it will not affect the program", Krikalaev noted.
The Progress MS-21 truck was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket on October 26.
Two days later, it was docked with the small search module on the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered over 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA has named the Progress airlock.
The decompression of the Progress MS-21 cargo ship on the International Space Station (ISS) was accomplished in the thermoregulation system.
This was reported by a representative of the American Flight Control Center (FCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the coolant leak from the Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all the refrigerant is gone.
"This morning we had a coolant leak from the thermoregulation system into space, the coolant leak has stopped", the American Central Utilities representative said (quoted by "Interfax").
Earlier, due to the de-pressurization, the "Progress" circuit was isolated.
Roscosmos has confirmed that the astronauts are safe.
Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11th, and will be removed from orbit, as scheduled, on February 18th.

Deputy Director of the Russian Railways proposed to governor of Irkutsk region to master new sales areas
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to explore alternative outlets beyond the Far East.
This is both the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
The proposal was made by Deputy Director of Russian Railways Alexey Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
As the past year has shown, even in spite of the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our "companies" (ports, operators, maritime transport) and find optimal price conditions for transporting their products according to new schemes, "Alexei Shilo emphasized.
Governor noted the importance of the stability of shipment of products, Irkutsk region is one of the richest mineral resources of the regions of the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of stone and brown coal.
There are about 25 coal mining enterprises in the region.
The instability of export shipments has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
The Minister stressed that Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, therefore it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of wood materials and products of the metallurgical industry produced in the region to the level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Recognizing the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to support transportation.
If additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market appear, we are also ready to provide assistance in this direction, - said Alexey Shilo.
Konstantin Zaysev held a meeting with the active citizens of the villages of Granovshchina and Khumutovo
On the instructions of the head of the region Igor Kobzev, today the Chairman of the Government of Angaria Constantine Zaytsev worked in the villages of Granovshchina and Homutovo of Irkutsk District.
In the village of Granovščina, the Chairman of the Government got acquainted with the work of the new educational institution - the Granovska school, which was opened in September 2022.
The object was built within the framework of the federal project "Modern School" of the national project "Education".
The following are located in eight school blocks: study rooms, dining room, dining hall, assembly hall, two sports halls, club rooms, a library, administrative rooms, toilets, recreation facilities for general use, a medical block.
For the construction was directed from the federal budget 240,8 million rubles, more than 512 million rubles - regional funds and more than 72 million rubles of the municipal entity.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment in the amount of 64.2 million rubles.
After the opening of the school in addition to children from the village of Granovshchina were the children of the Urikova school, which was undergoing a major renovation.
Lessons are taught by more than 100 teachers, of whom almost 90 are teachers of subjects.
In 2022, the school received a bus purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation under the federal program.
The capital repair of the Khumutovo secondary general education school No 2 began in 2022.
Elementary students were assigned to Khumoutovka School No. 1, the upper classes are in the second building of school No. 2.
According to the repair plan, the roof, engineering communications, windows and related elements will be replaced, the facade will be repaired, the interior decoration of the premises will be performed.
An important component of the major repairs was the reconstruction of a thermal point with water heating, instead of which dry heat was used.
The cost of all the works - more than 80 million rubles.
We're in the final stages of repairs, we have a problem connecting to the grid, we need to add capacity, we're working with the power company.
In addition, in the Granovshchyna and Homutovo, Konstantin Zaytsov held a meeting with citizens, some of whom were sold houses illegally connected to the electricity network.
It was decided that the network company would host a face-to-face meeting next week to resolve the legal issues.
- Very often the question of a stable power supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electricity for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes unwittingly connect homes to the nearby grid, which is a good reason to cut power.
Therefore, network companies in areas where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue, - said Konstantin Zaytsov.

Anatoly Prokopiev took under personal control the construction of two kilometers of the road from the Harjashin area to the mouth of the Horde.
The main activities of Stalina Mogzoyeva KFH in the village of Otonkoi are the breeding of cattle and buffalo.
In 2020, the farm participated in the competitive selection and received a "AGROSTARTAP" grant for the development of a peasant meat production.
For these funds, a tractor trailer, two press-pickers, and a mower were purchased.
The head of the farm increases his cattle every year and increases the gross meat production.
In addition, the farm sows one-year forage crops on an area of 40 hectares.
Stalina Mogzoyeva plans to open a fattening area.
After visiting three farms, the head of the district noted that the measures of state support are effective, necessary, necessary.

Agriculture producers of the district are doing this role with honor, - said Anatoly Prokopiev.
Armenian-Turkish border crossing opened for first time in decades for humanitarian aid
Margarat-Alidjan border crossing on the border between Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
This is reported by Turkish and Armenian media.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating 1988 earthquake, the Turkish news agency Anadolu reports.
Armenia sent five trucks carrying 100 tons of food, medicine, water and other emergency aid to the southern Turkish city of Adyaman on Saturday, Ankara's special representative to the Armenian-Turkish talks, Serdar Kılıç, said.
He expressed his gratitude to the Deputy Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Reuben Rubinian and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the region affected by the earthquake", Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
Armenia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Vaan Unanyan in turn announced that trucks carrying humanitarian aid had crossed the border via the Margara Bridge and were headed to the earthquake-hit region.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margar bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish news agency Anadolu cites other accounts, saying that the Margar-Alijhan border crossing was last used to deliver humanitarian supplies to Armenia in the aftermath of a devastating 1988 earthquake.
At that time, assistance from the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the earthquake-hit areas.
According to the latest data, more than 25,000 people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on February 11 that 21,848 people have died in Turkey.
On the Syrian side, 3,553 were reported killed.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are clouded mainly by Ankara's refusal to recognize the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and by its support for Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss issues of normalization.
In February 2022, commercial air service between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

"Fernandez is the Makelele and Lampard.
If you want him to play the Mekelle position, he can play there very well.
This guy also has a good goal sensation, a good shot from outside the box, so if you need him to play behind a striker, like Lampard or Essien, he can do that", Crespo told British media.

The prediction for the World Club Championship game on February 11, 2023.
The Sports Express.
The forecast for the match of the Club World Cup "Real" - "Al-Hilal" on February 11, 2023
On February 11, the final of the Club World Cup will be played at the Prince Mullah Abdullah Stadium in Rabat, Morocco.
The match for the trophy will be between Real Madrid and Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia.
The game will start at 22:00 Moscow time, and the live broadcast at 21.55 Moscow time will be shown by the matchtv.ru website and the TV channel "Match! Football 2".
Analysts of bookmaking company BETSITI consider the "blancos" to be the biggest favorites: you can bet on the victory of "Real" in the main time with a coefficient of 1.28, probability of about 77%.
Success for nominal guests is available for 11.0 (8%).
Even at a tie, the offer is markedly lower at 6.10 (15%).
Do you believe the teams can't find a winner in 90 minutes?
A bet of 1000 rubles on a "peaceful" result in the case of a win will bring 6100 rubles.
To place a bet on the Madrid triumph, taking into account the extra time and penalty shootout, is 1.14, this market for Al-Hilal goes for 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia on the way to the final, overcame two rounds, defeating Moroccan "Vidad" in the penalty shootout and Brazilian "Flamengo" in the main time (3:2).
You bet the underdog doesn't lose to the Europeans in 90 minutes, it's $3.90.
Analysts anticipate a large number of goals: a total of more than 2.5 balls available for 1.53, TM 2.5 - for 2.60.
The Blancos are clearly outclassed by their rivals, who, according to the statistics site Transfermarkt, only total 39.6 million euros.
For comparison, the Real roster is valued at 849 million euros.
And to the horror of Al-Hilal, for the final, the Madrid forward and current Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema will recover.
However, even without the Frenchman, Real are productive in this tournament: in the semi-finals, they defeated the Egyptian Al-Ahly 4-1.
The matches of the Arabs were also quite bright: in the 1/4 finals they drew 1: 1 and won the penalty shootout, and in the semi-final - dramatic 3: 2.
Recommended bet: Real and TB 2.5 to 1.76.
Governiev spoke about the fact that midfielder Pavel Mamaev decided to end his playing career.
The famous TV commentator Dmitry Guberniyev spoke about the fact that the midfielder Pavel Mamaev decided to end his playing career.
"Now you can pour a bust in the hero's homeland.
He made a big mistake, and for most people, he will be remembered not as a footballer, but as a football delinquent.
But he's still a long way from Cochrane.
Because no one has ever screwed up their potential like Kokorin did.
Mamaev, for all his talents, was periodically noticed.
I can only wish him luck and to realize himself somewhere else", - quotes Guberniyev Metaratings.ru.
The 34-year-old midfielder's last club was "Khimki".
The Moscow club did not renew the contract with the midfielder in the summer of 2022.

A tanker with diesel from a previously Russian-flagged vessel was not allowed into the Spanish port
The naval command of Tarragona of the General Directorate of the Merchant Fleet of the Spanish Ministry of Transport has banned the entry into the port of the city of Maersk Magellan to discharge diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel, which until July 1, 2022 flew under the Russian flag, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Tarragona Maritime Command of the Merchant Fleet General Directorate under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has prohibited the entry into the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel on the Singapore-flagged Maersk Magellan ship because the cargo it is carrying comes from the Cameroonian-flagged Nobel vessel, which until July 1, 2022 sailed under the Russian flag", the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in line with European Union law banning access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag after 16 April 2022 or that changes flag after 24 February 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed.

Pregnant Russian women have problems entering Argentina explained
According to the expert, due to the influx of people wanting to have a baby in Argentina, authorities have started to monitor the entry of foreign nationals more carefully.
The difficulties for pregnant Russian women to enter Argentina are due to the fact that the authorities of the country are not interested in the mass influx of foreigners who want to get citizenship for their children and residency permits for themselves, and then leave.
This is reported by "Lenta.ru" with reference to SPbSU professor Victor Heifetz, editor-in-chief of the magazine "Latin America".
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transit point rather than a destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
The expert explained that the child would keep the Argentine citizenship, but the decision regarding whether or not to issue an Argentine passport to the parents after obtaining a residence permit would be made by a court.
If it turns out that they never actually lived in Argentina and left immediately, they can be denied citizenship.
This concerns not only Russians, but citizens of other countries as well.
Recently, the expert pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship based on the "right of the soil", that is, if a person is born on its territory.
An Argentine passport allows visa-free travel to 170 countries, including the EU and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began revoking the residency permits of Russians who received the document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires has an interest in reducing these cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina on suspicion of providing false data about the motives of the trip.
Russia to open hundreds of new fitness clubs
In Russia, citizens' interest in fitness services is reviving, which is allowing market participants to expand their business.
More than 400 new facilities, mostly small-scale ones, could open in the country this year.
About 400 new fitness clubs could open in Russia, and their total number could increase by 5 percent.
According to Kommersant, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-scale projects with small initial investments and quick return.
This is according to the National Fitness Association.
President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators Olga Kiseleva noted in an interview with the publication that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
NFS President Elena Silina noted that since 2020, there have been more closures each year than openings.
In the last three years, their numbers have declined by 37 percent.
However, independent analysts cite other figures.
According to Contour.Focus, in the last three years the number of organizations with the main activity of "fitness center work" has increased by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but as early as 2021, it started to recover.
According to 2GIS, there are 4,500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with millions of inhabitants.
Russians have increased their attention to physical activity, as shown by an increase in the number of fitness clubs.
As of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year over year.
As Silina noted, if the trend is maintained, the industry will return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.
The Kirov management company lost its license
The arbitration court of Kirov region has annulled the license for business activity for the management of apartment buildings issued by the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, a decision of the regional Arbitration Court cancelled the license for business activities in the management of multi-apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Zabota".
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made in November 2022, but only entered into force in February 2023.
The arbitration stripped the "manager" of her license for ignoring the order of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently all the objects that were in the care management have been removed from the register of licenses for the implementation of entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64,800 square meters.
All the houses are in the regional center.
The fact that they have lost their management company is known to the Kirov administration.
In accordance with the requirements of the Russian law, the State Housing Inspectorate has informed the city hall of the situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region Alexander Sokolov set the objective for the employees of the State Housing Inspection to liquidate 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, as there are too many of them.
The legitimacy of the governor's demands caused doubts among the Kirov communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could have been taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The Antimonopolis allegedly also asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the head of the region.
Wildberries will charge for the packages at delivery points.
The Wildberries Marketplace is making packages at pick-up points payable from February 13th.
They will vary from 6 to 15 rubles.
Now the packages are provided by the owners of the delivery points.
If they're not, there's a fine.
As of Monday, February 13, packages at Wildberries outlets will no longer be accepted free.
Users of the marketplace received a notice that buyers who need the package would have to pay from 6 to 15 rubles for it.
This amount will be deducted from the card in the personal account.
The company said that the move would help reduce the use of plastic and help conserve the environment.
As is clear from the annex to the offer for delivery services for individuals, the executor, i.e. the person who has set up an issue point, must provide the parcels free of charge at the request of the customer.
The design must be in certain colors and have a certain image.
The packages are purchased at the expense of the owners of the PVC, if this obligation is not fulfilled, they are fined in the amount of 10000 rubles for each violation.
Earlier, Wildberries customers had found the site charging cash from cards that had previously been deleted from their personal accounts.
This carries major security risks, consumers fear.
Their support team explained that this was part of the user agreement.
As a consequence, the company has the right to withdraw money from deleted cards without notifying the customer if payment from others does not proceed for one reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, said that the payments with customers are carried out with the permission of customers, and that no leak of bank card data can happen.
Photos from February 2023.
A lovely spot, especially in the summer, around the mammoth sculpture and a gazebo with a manger.
It's not a big park to go out with your family.
The big parking lot.
The store is on the first floor of the University City Mall.
The opening hours are from 10 to 22.
At the shop, you can enjoy a cup of coffee and freshly baked goods.
There's a small parking lot off the mall.
The friendly staff!
Great coffee, great selection of syrups and alternative milk.
This is the best fresh pastry ever.
Full of sandwiches.
Convenient area of the cafeteria.
We used to come with our daughter to do the pension.
We took it in kindly, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, registered the application, told how to make an appointment for the next appointment.
On entry, the administrator and security are greeted with civility and respect.
The building is decent, with facilities to accommodate the crowd... a hall, a toilet, but a water cooler would be nice.
We've been here twice, it's great!
I wish all workers peace, good, good luck and a decent salary, in this difficult time for all!!!
This is a great place.
After a long walk on the beach, there's nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of glint wine, waiting for a combi salad (which is delicious!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
The nice cashier asked me to make a cup of coffee for me with her or in the hall, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked for 300 in the hall.
A few minutes later, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to be in ceramics, so it's "in the hall".
I got busted.
I'm asking why in a cup and not a cup?
The girl says, they don't have a 300-ml cup.
Is that how it fits in a person's head?
To ask yourself or the audience, that is, to determine the technology for yourself to pour coffee into a cup or in a disposable cup.
The answer is in the room, i.e. in the cup.
Specify the volume.
To hear that 300 ml.
To confront the fact that there are no cups that size.
This is a paper cup, 300ml.
Remarkably, this is the third case in Green Eye that I can remember.
Twice as remarkable is that I wasn't offered a standard cup, so that I could pour the contents of a plastic cup into it and drink the coffee the way I wanted to drink it, and I asked for it myself.
There are a number of questions.
Is the Green Eye cafeteria and Green Eye two sides of the same coin or are they unrelated?
If they're not connected, there's an understanding.
If they're related, why is a food and retail enterprise known in the city for its service and quality reduced to the rhetoric of a kiosk at Kazan train station?
Rhetoric because this is the third time, I repeat, this has happened to me.
I can't rule out the possibility that this isn't just happening to me.
Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression she was acting on impulse.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please write down the action for your employees on this, in case you try to service.
We love the circus. We've been going there since we were kids.
I saw the show with Nikulin Yu himself.
And now with kids and nieces.
I like the atmosphere of the circus and the programs.
The seating arrangement is very convenient.
You can see the arena from almost anywhere, and the backs of the people ahead don't get in your way.
The circus is very intimate, family!
This time we went to the New Year's Eve program.
Just a little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I'd like a room with magic and lots of animals.
Too bad you can't take pictures with the animals in the lobby.
But there must be a reason for that.
Overall a very nice place!!
I wish you prosperity and please us with your performances!!!
Developer likes Building Department, chooses good sites for housing developments.
They use quality materials, which is totally worth the price.
Before we bought it, we were asked to look at the building, before the walls, so that we could see it in a real way, even though we looked at lots of apartments, and no developer offered us that.
The favorite ski resort of Russia!
The most fun is the shallow woods uh, especially when there's a lot of soft snow.
But the roads are boring and short.
The longest ones are in Sector E, there's even fewer.
But overall the atmosphere is great, lots of different cafes and bars, so a fun skiing mood is guaranteed!
A very good Master Perry!
She did everything as quickly and as efficiently as possible, and the cabin was clean and comfortable.
Good service, friendly staff, dressing room and water.
Disgusting service.
This is the second time I've come to pick up my order at a time listed on the app and I've had to wait at my window for more than 30 minutes for my order.
This service is unacceptable in business today.
The answer from Care Services is that we're trying.
At the box office, no apologies, just, it's not our fault, it's the program.
No phone call, no other technical means of communication with regular, previously loyal customers.
The impotents are trying, and the business needs to work.
Thank you very much, everyone.
We won't be ordering from you again, much less recommending.
A spoiled mood, waiting for the guests, an apology from the hostess is not the best sauce for hot rolls.
Ordered a Jeep Wrangler Sahara through the organization.
He expects to receive the car after 3-3,5 months (as was agreed), but the fact was 4,5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania executed).
As a result, I'm very pleased with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and normal human attitude.
Thank you again.
We rented a cabin for four days for three people.
The houses are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary dishes.
There's laundry detergent and a sponge.
One of the disadvantages is the lack of space, with a terribly small shower in the bathroom.
There's no storage for snowboards or skies, and nowhere to dry things, so the owners had to get a dryer and stick it in there instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
Well, it's a good option, in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes sufficient to meet the needs of any guest.
The prices are reasonable.
There's wine and beer for those who want a drink.
The center of Moscow, I recommend
It's a great place with a very polite staff, so we'll definitely come back.
It has all the necessary amenities, including parking and a billiard table.
Well-maintained rooms with all the amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, walked around during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I loved it, and Russia in miniature, and the Lakes Park and the landscape.
In winter there are a lot of natural hills for the children)
Very cool tobacco and hookah store.
We shop here all the time, the prices are low, the quality is good!
Very helpful staff, will inform and answer any questions)
I recommend this store to everyone! ❤️
The location is convenient for everyone.
It's fine by me.
They serve quickly if any of the visitors are not dumb.
It's convenient on the record.
The staff are attentive, will give you tips, instructions, even if you don't come on reception days.
It's mostly fine.
You guys are great!
Thank you so much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, the prices were reasonable compared to other services.
I thought the remote was disposable, and they were so smart they did everything to me.
A big thank you to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with a two-hour delivery on March 8.
6 hours later, the flowers arrived in packs as if stolen (there was just enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then when the flowers were in the vase, I knew something was wrong.
Compared it to the photo on the website, and the color is nothing like what I ordered.
I decided to count and it turned out that there were an even number of tulips 20 pieces.
The WhatsApp support, to my outrage about the color and the number of flowers, said, "We must have the wrong color".
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
I feel this is an extreme level of impudence and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I already filed my tax return with the IRS about being denied a check.
It's Rospotrebnadzor and the court.
I don't recommend anyone get involved with this organization.
I've been going to Samira's for 10 years, to have my hair dyed and cut.
I want to cancel Master Samira's professionalism, she does her job perfectly, I'm always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to her client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I highly recommend this master to all my family and friends.
All her work is always at the highest level!!!
A big thank you to Master Samira 😍
Welcome to this gaming club, I can say the prices are great, lots of gaming computers, drinks and food.
The negative is that some keyboards are broken, buttons fly, if you consider the normal game process then the computer is bad to hold:
So the score is 4.
This place has become a family tradition.
Son goes to his band, mom goes to a gym at night.
The administrators are super attentive, the coaches are professional.
They throw themed parties for the kids, keep the place clean and gyms.
It's nice to walk and exercise.
The 6-year-old has a good grip, a strong BFA.
Recommended for children, mothers and fathers)
The best of the best!
Irina is gold!
She does the work well, carefully, with precision.
There's always something to talk about with a girl!
It was the third time!
I won 't regret it!
Finally, I can grow my hair back after lightening!!!
And Vita is studying color.
So it is she who will soon be able to combine the flour with the keratin!
And your hair will say thank you
Master receptionist Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, explained clearly everything that is included in the regulatory TO.
She also helped me when my car was being repaired.
And gratitude to the master Valery Ushakov for the careful and professional work.
I was ready to answer any question.
The work is done well.
The only thing that was confusing when registering for the TO was not enough correct information about the work regulations, when coming to the TO, the regulation was more clearly explained.
I want to express my gratitude to the administration staff.
It took a very rare, legal documentation for a trustee to approve the real estate transaction, and the staff was so good at helping us with this documentation, although they could have refused, because it was not their job.
Thank you so much!
There are some very soulful people here.
Lovely, kind, polite employees, who did not regret coming to this barbershop!👍
Master Nahida did a perfect inking, cut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend it to everyone❤️
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
Renovated for the 800th anniversary, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There is also a cafe and toilets for tourists.
I went on a field trip, and it was great.
And I would definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum, an unexpectedly beautiful collection.
I've known Ole for over three years, we use the service regularly.
During this time we've seen Olya grow in her chosen profession, continually learning new things and expanding the space for quadrupeds, which only inspires admiration and trust.
We always leave our dogs with a peace of mind.
Daily video reports, picked up by a zootaxy if necessary.
They'll bring you something clean and tasty.
It's a fairy tale.
Thank you for your care and attention to our pets 💜
The Saty Los restaurant is next to the Medvedkovo metro.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They make delicious meals.
The menu is varied.
Make reservations in advance, especially on Fridays.
It's a nice, well-kept zoo.
Less Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
There were 300 adults and 170 students.
There were not many people, and we enjoyed walking, watching the animals.
The Ant was impressed.
Nobody's seen him in Moscow, by the way.
There are a couple of cafes on the property with reasonable prices, a clean toilet is free, as well as a phone charging station.
Anyway, I highly recommend it.
The salon is top notch!!!
I'm very satisfied with the services of the beautician Natalia Kuznetsova, I only go to her.
I do a variety of facials, both hardware and mechanical.
I'm 100% pleased.
Master of his craft👍
It's so detailed about my skin, it's a skin care product for my skin type, just perfect.
I'm happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you Natalia!!!
A great club with a huge space, swimming pool, sauna, hammam and great coaches!
The downside is the massive number of retired people in the pool and locker room.
Feels like they're coming to a club like a public bath!
Special emphasis on the women's section.
On working days, there's a lot of people at 7:00.
I'll put three there, and only because of the first visit she had to a therapist, if I'm not mistaking Timur, but I could be wrong.
He made everything quickly, told everything +/-, everything clearly, the son also decided to make a card, and unfortunately consultants are busy with their own work, clients are waiting, the son was approached by a consultant, who was up to light bulbs, was spotted several times in the meeting room, which was fun to talk about, the son finally left, without making anything, the consultant said, well, whatever you want, as I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
New office, new layout, all the comforts, and the attitude.
It's a pity that the first impression was overwritten, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards the customers doesn't depend on the change of employees.
The selection is very wide, the quality is good ((the fabric is resistant to the appearance of cuts), the staff knows their assortment, help in choosing the styles.
You can dress a slim girl and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They're close to the subway, there's even a small parking lot.
We recommend it.
I was in September, celebrating my birthday.
Basically, we like the service and the quality of the food, the prices are low, the portions are medium, so you can eat or order again.
The only complaint is the table reservation.
When you ordered, you just gave me the number and everything you needed, and then the bot immediately called to check the phone.
This is it.
When I arrived at the restaurant, I found that there was no reservation.
Fortunately, there were seats available and we were able to stay.
So it's actually a very good restaurant with a very good value for money.
I recommend it.
I went to the cleaners last weekend.
It is the first time I've seen such an organized staff who have responded to many of my questions with tremendous care, telling me how and what to do for the treatment of cavity of the tooth.
Highly recommend, the only clinic that doesn't want to make money off my memory.
It's a good mall.
We have everything!
A wide range of goods.
A variety of shops.
You can always find a good product.
From food to gifts.
Don't ever set foot in that store again.
We bought a washing machine, they said it was out of town, so we took it.
The manager in the room said, where to go to the warehouse, to the "load up?" said yes.)
They carried out the shipment without a box, when I asked why, they said they all did.
When I insisted, they slipped me two strips of Penoplex, like it would fit!
Refuse to load into the trailer, say it's not their job, load yourselves, they have delivery.)))
When I told them I wouldn't do it again, they said, "Well, whatever" one of them finally got down the ramp to help his father get the car in the trailer.
This is the worst service I've ever seen.
Nice mall. Clean and tidy. Big selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a movie theater "Cosmic" a children's entertainment center "Unseen".
There's a large Lenta store on the ground floor.
Convenient, large parking lot is a convenient location.
Good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear and household goods.
A wide variety, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
The counselors are sure to help you with the choice, give you advice.
Everyone will find something for themselves.
It's a nice place to spend an evening.
Very good staff, nice place.
I recommend that you never make a mistake. The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be superb.
I suggest you visit)
We would like to thank Marina Clock, who was our funeral planner.
Coming to us on call, she took over the handling of all issues relating to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always in touch and informed how things were going.
She made it possible for us to say goodbye to a loved one.
Everything was clear, organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, perfectly aware of the plight of her loved ones, gave us advice and, humanly, she sympathized with us.
He's a very good expert in his field.
Thank you for everything.
After so many positive reviews, I applied to RemStirMash, and I was assigned to be taught by Alexander.
He began by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready to help.
We all discussed it and set a time for 2:00.
The next day came - a call from the master in the morning and a statement that he could not come, a complex request (how is it? Where is "perfectly free?") and if he can, instead of the appointed 14.00, he will come after 18.00.
We'll do it again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another craftsman calls and says that he can come in place of Alexander, but in two hours.
What are these tricks?
A day and a half of idle waiting, all the scheduled work aside!
In short, the clever master Ivan has come and fixed the malfunction, for which I thank him.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and waste your time.
The night's sightings have failed to meet expectations.
So first there was a little lecture with some obscure material, and then we looked through the telescope.
It was not very well organized, and children were crawling in a few times, and the adults were crowded out, so that they could not let others see.
The objects we were looking at with the telescope were the size of stars, and free to look at without a telescope.
The girl answered questions not very accessible, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
I don't know why 600.
This amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
A cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price is average.
Sit down, eat 2-3 dishes for two (portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 r👌
There are interesting beer cocktails based on beer and tequila, like Macho Boracho, that I highly recommend you try.
The price is 420 for 0.5 liters.
And actually the restaurant itself has a very delicious cuisine, I don't know how others, but I really like it, I recommend my friends to go there for sure)
It's a great store, I've been buying the goods for a long time, since they opened.
Good quality goods.
I bought a blender, it's been five years, and it's working properly and in good condition.
So when they did the overall renovation of the apartment, they took everything they needed from here.
This is a great gas station!!!
Very conveniently located, is the center and side of the area, generally convenient)!
The gas quality is good, I fill up 2 times a week for more than 2 years, no problems, the price is great!!!
Orlat does not cheat on credit cards or cash.
The store, I like it!
You can choose any model, at a democratic price, for any purpose!
The staff, always willing to help with the selection.
He took a notebook for his daughter to study with because his notebook got stuck.
They helped, picked up, gave guarantee ((month) Thank you! 👍
The sommelier is working.
He helped with the wine selection, because it's hard to sort out that huge menu on your own.
The experience of working with the catfish is interesting, charming Vasily, such in Moscow are not enough.
ELA SUDAK is magic, respect the cook.
The kids' menu is just like everywhere else- pasta, fries, chicken cutlets.
The adults had truffles, and the kids had ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate the smoked ribs - it's the bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
The staff is nice, everyone's smiling, friendly.
We liked it.
WB's brand new ordering point is conveniently located.
Opening hours are from 10:00 to 21:00, excluding weekends and holidays.
There are some dressing rooms inside the airlock.
This is a very good place.
There are real professionals here, always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat on Whatsapp for informative communication.
It's a quick release.
It's nice to know that you can see the goods and try them on right away.
Nice to be close to home.
It's a great, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything stated in the description is in stock.
Breakfast is included, a wide selection for every taste.
Easy access, private parking near the entrance.
Hard five.
It's a great puppet show.
We often go to different shows.
We went to the Frog Queen tonight.
This is the best of the children's shows so far.
It was very interesting, lots of dolls, special effects.
Even my 14-year-old son, he just wanted the company, said it was a really good show.
We went on vacation with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
The rest was a "B", everybody loved it.
I 'll start in order:
The day of our arrival, they called, specified what time to wait for us, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850p), arrived quickly, there was no traffic, the scab was let in without any problems.
The administration building is down the hall, done quickly, 15 to 20 minutes.
All the buildings have elevators, that's a big plus!
2 - room room is spacious, floors both in the room and in the bathroom warm (without heating), a huge balcony with rotang furniture (table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in 5 corpus).
The furniture in the room is ordinary, there's a ladies' table with a big mirror, the fridge is not so small, there's even a freezer.
There's a lot of green plants in Building 5.
It's clean, change towels and laundry when you want, but if you don't ask to change it, they still change it on the fourth day, good quality laundry.
The grounds are well maintained, with shops everywhere, clear paths, and beautiful lights in the evening.
There's a minibus to and from the beach every 30 minutes.
Public transport stop is five minutes away.
They're in the dining room, the friendly people, always wishing you a good day.
The food was decent, but whoever came for what, it was all very well for us, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and chips or other things, vegetables in the side dish every day, baked delicious, more than 4 drinks, coffee from cereal, pancakes for breakfast, only the cheese and sausage are not very.
The medical staff are very friendly and loyal.
We were lucky with the weather, no rain, the temperature was 11-16 degrees, sunshine.
We really had a good time, really relaxed.
There is a desire to come again and precisely in January, when there are few vacationers)).
Too bad they're never gonna open up the pool and the gym.
Thank you to the entire staff of the sanatorium for their coordinated and quality work!
We've been going to Flight since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She's the one who likes it, the coach praises her) that's the most important thing.
We are going to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I never thought the dojo could be so flexible!
Strolling through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to take a look at this promising establishment - and we were right!
The prices are very reasonable, and the unbelievably delicious pizza is eaten without even a crust.
Nice atmosphere and charming staff, I recommend it.
You just happened to be in Tomorow's hospital with high blood pressure and a high heart rate.
And I was very surprised: the cleanliness, the order, the wet cleaning twice, even the wiping of the window sills, furniture and doors.
The food is dietary, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 in the morning they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, everyone is giving both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While the I.V. is on, they'll come in and ask how you're doing...
Before had to do an ultrasound of the heart, but this is the first time (I don't know the name of the doctor, a young man).
A special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Klaudia Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, literate, giving an exhaustive answer to any question; she picked up the dosage and medicines that normalized both pressure and heart rate, which she could not achieve after consulting other doctors.
Thank you to the head doctor Mevse Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the harmonious work of the hospital!!!
Thank you to the paramedics and the nurses and the drivers!
When I visited customer service, I had a good impression.
I met the administrator in the lobby.
The competent and polite staff help customers quickly and patiently with all questions.
The specialist assisted in filing the application and clarified my question.
It's a pretty good selection for a small shop.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, all kinds of little stuff.
It's 24/7, which is very convenient, and it's always a friendly staff.
It's nice to have a place in town where you can go mountain biking.
Boogeyman lifts and on the weekend the final queue gathers 40 seconds down and 5-10 minutes in the queue.
But overall, it's great to see, and the atmosphere is so nice in the winter, even if the roads are dirty and damp.
I went to the service for an iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery had to be replaced.
I contacted the master Alexander, who explained all the intricacies of the repair and immediately indicated the pricing.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done very well.
The masters are very sociable, they show you everything and tell you everything.
However, when the parts were replaced, the camera was affected, the focus was off.
I reported the problem right away and got a quick response.
It was rectified as soon as possible, and everything is operating properly.
This service has good experts, who I like to talk to.
The prices, compared to other services, are reasonable.
If I need repairs again, I'll be sure to call.
It's large, beautiful and atmospheric.
But like most historic sites, its condition requires the careful, prompt, and quality attention of restorers.
So 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the maintainers.
A great railroad.
Responsive concierges, garbage removed, clean and beautiful area, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
They have opened a nice, cozy place in our neighborhood.
There's all the shops you need.
A killer and diverse food court.
The capitals are located in cozy zones.
There is no boredom.
So, we went, we tried it...
The interior has nothing in common with a cozy Italian café...
Very little space, the tables are rectangular, like in a dining room.
Pizza... If you haven't had it before, you'll love it. She seemed kind of faceless to me.
Didn't like that the waiter was always standing behind you and almost always looking the person you were talking to in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
The connoisseurs, yes, they are delicious.
We won't be coming here again, and I won't be recommending it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best hair and makeup artist I've ever had.
She is very professional and I like going to her, I know that everything will be done perfectly.
I only take my daughter to see Lena.
The atmosphere in the salon is amazing.
Thank you very much.
We broke down on the way down from Lowery, and the good people at Cut Resources came to the rescue!
Respect for you and prosperity, more people like you!
And the server room is clean and nice!
We came to a concert by Sergei Chigrakov.
Great concert venue, great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely go to the concerts this year.
A quiet place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music on weekends and holidays!
The staff is nice and helpful!
There's a nursery.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I love this place.
The park is in the middle of the city, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there's room for both children and adults.
But the playground hasn't had sand for a long time, but only dust.
There's also a fenced football field, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there's more to our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are foods that can only be bought at The Intersection.
The staff is friendly.
I didn't eat bad food.
Often promotions and discounts.
Glad to be close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
Been to the bar twice, really enjoyed everything, the friendly staff, the delicious food, and most importantly, the great music, the DJs know their business.
The only, second time the lead singer of the band "Hands Up Band" disappoints.
Not only does she sing softly not very, but also reads the lyrics of most of the songs from the phone, especially when it was songs by the band "Hands up".
Somehow it doesn't make any sense (performing at The Hands Up Bar, in the Hands Up Band).
We were on vacation in early March.
It's a good hotel, nice rooms.
For his birthday, he got a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Cleaning the room every day.
Refund water, tea, coffee, shampoo and a change of towels.
Breakfast was amazing.
There's a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order food from the restaurant in the room, charge 20% off.
The restaurant prices are a little high.
Tastes like a three plus.
The water park was included in the price of the accommodation.
The water park itself is not the best in Russia.
But the masseuse was the bomb.
All is well, but the departure is a bit disappointing, no goodbye, no happy travels.
The staff at the entrance didn't even help me open the door when he saw the women with a lot of bags and suitcases.
We'll have to work on that to keep the mark.
It's a great place to get together with friends and party.
A big, comfortable steam room with pool, an outdoor pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh.
The workshop is level!
In a short time, he had already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 husbands and 1 wife).
It's all right.
The quality of the work is top notch.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality of work!
What a great school of basketball!
My son's walking for five months, and he loves it, he looks forward to every workout.
Individual approach to children, interesting activities, warm and caring atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff is great, I order online myself.
Great location for a store.
Plus, there's always discounts and promotions, which is good, too.
A good AV shop is a convenient location, a large hall, a good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their help!
There's a cafeteria for several tables.
I come a lot, and it's all right.
What a pool!
I am talking about a "frog", our coach Anastasia Vitalievna is very liked by the child and professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, there are fences!
I love the cupcake stand, the service, the croissants, the breakfast, and the coffee always at the top.
But unfortunately, not this time, ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the counter didn't make the coffee until I reminded them it was made, they can't drink it, it smells and tastes like spoiled milk, decided not to finish, and I just walked off.
Last time I had a long black hair in my coffee, it was replaced.
Pay more attention please, as there is no way I'm a guest coming back here, even after such incidents.
The fancy eyebrows are in here!
Victoria is a great adjuster, taking into account all the facial proportions individually.
Fixed with warm wax, which well cleans all the fur and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected by hair type and skin type, so the dye is long-lasting.
Better not make eyebrows!
Thank you so much for arranging my mom's move!
Moving is always stressful, but with your company, it went very smoothly, quickly, efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
All at the highest level.
Our whole family has been treating our teeth in Novodent for a long time.
Recently my 8-year-old had some dental work done, it went really well, the child is calm and ready to come back.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because you can book in advance.
I feel like the best stew in Tambov is here, I'm not a stew man, but when you want something bad only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat with lots of stuffing.
And I don't know why, but it never runs.
Often the time you finish a shawrma you don't eat anymore because there's a lot of sauce and water...but not here.
That's why you guys are the best 🙂
Good teaching staff.
The food in the dining room is always fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various activities during the school year
Nice shop, polite staff, good selection.
However, the big downside is that the goods that are coming in are likely to be destroyed right in the mall.
Sometimes there is little room for movement in between the rows and it's also not very pleasant when the goods are directly on the floor without pallets, but it's more of a comment on the organisation than a specific store
A wonderful example of Soviet architecture.
A stern splendour that is tended to with care.
I enjoyed the concert twice over, in large part because of the atmosphere of the cultural center.
As we were waiting in the lobby for the event to begin, I clearly felt I had come to the Event, that it was really an outing.
I was looking for a clutch kit for his MB Sprinter.
I stumbled across this online auto parts store.
He called, gave me the VIN code, told me to wait.
Ten minutes later, they called back, offered some options.
Because the personal-working machine did not save and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
Five minutes later, they called and said they had good news for you.
If you do not take the whole basket + disk + the backing, but take LUK set of basket + disk and separate backing LUK, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
Took the clutch and went to the garage.
With the gearbox removed, it was discovered that a flywheel was still needed, and the sooner the better.
I knew where to turn), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by phone (for the first time he also paid when receiving).
The next day, the flying machine was in my hands.
The car is happy with the new suspension and clutch and I'm happy that everything came so fast, that we went to the meeting.
I would definitely recommend vinkod.shop.
The New Year's Eve party was a success, but with some flaws.
I booked a double, and I got put in for a four.
But not trouble.
It's just weird that we didn't warn you.
Kitchen on four, the fish didn't work at all.
Leading with competitions made at a school-level turnpoint, to be honest, not very.
But with the music, it's perfect.
The atmosphere was high.
Everything else seems like a stretch.
Thank you for the event.
I leave my comment, with words of gratitude to all staff of the maternity home number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
This facility only has people who know and love their jobs, doctors and nurses by God.
Both in the maternity ward and the maternity ward, and the postpartum ward.
But I especially want to thank Y.Y. Kotlerova, the head of the maternity ward of the fifth floor, and N.V. Yarenzeva, a midwife in the maternity ward, thank you very much for your help in the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
This is a beautiful shop.
Big range of balloons, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
Visited the facility on recommendation.
The food was amazing, the program was not, the waiters were a little cheeky, but we were a great group with the kids and we were celebrating an important event, it was friendly.
There was no fire pitch, the kids were waiting.
A good kitchen is a safe place to go.
