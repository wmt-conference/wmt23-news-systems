Rabies cases rise in northeast Thailand
Dr. Tawichai of the 9th Office of Disease Control and Prevention said on February 9th that rabies infections have been increasing in northeastern Thailand in recent months, bringing the total number of cases to 74.
So far this fiscal year (October last year to September this year), a total of 74 people have tested positive for rabies, 67 in Surin and 7 in Buriram provinces in the northeast.
All had been vaccinated against rabies in the past, they said.
He is urging people to get vaccinated against rabies with their pets and not to touch the saliva of animals suspected of being infected.
Rabies is transmitted to humans not only from dogs, but also from cats and bats.
Almost 100% of people who become infected and develop the disease die, but vaccination before the onset of symptoms can prevent death.

Fuji develops system to prevent accident of leaving car behind, tests it on company vehicle | Chubu Keizai Newspaper Economic information for Aichi, Gifu, Mie and Shizuoka
Fuji (headquartered in Chiryu City), a company that manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has begun developing a system to prevent children from being left behind in cars.
A motion sensor is installed in the car, and when it detects a person's movement, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
The company is currently conducting a demonstration experiment using a shuttle bus at its facility.
Protecting the safety of children even in the face of tragic accidents caused by neglect.
Currently, a demonstration experiment is being carried out with two pick-up vehicles from "teracoya THANK," an English conversation after-school program for children that the company runs in Chiryu.
Motion sensors that detect people's movements based on the temperature difference between people and their surroundings have been installed in three locations on the ceiling of the car.
If the vehicle detects human movement after a certain amount of time has passed with the engine turned off and the doors closed, a warning notification will be sent automatically.
By linking information with the condition of the engine and doors, false positives are prevented as much as possible.
Warning notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling a pre-registered number, it will be displayed in a chat on a computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and care is taken to prevent mistakes such as missing them.
The demonstration experiment is expected to continue until the end of February.
Kamiya Ikko, manager of Section 2 of the Innovation Promotion Department, pointed out, "During the experiment, peripheral issues other than the system became visible."
For example, they were able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"I want to expand our solutions," he said.
The development of the leave-behind prevention system was triggered by a series of accidents where shuttle buses were left behind across the country.
An employee with young children suggested something they could do to keep their children safe.
They decided to develop it to make use of the know-how they have cultivated through their factory automation (FA) related business, such as information management using IoT (Internet of Things) and sensors.
Fuji's leave-behind prevention system is known for its ease of use.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to pick-up and drop-off vehicles, the company aims to lower the barriers to adoption and popularize it.
In the future, the company will consider commercializing the product with the cooperation of nursery schools and kindergartens.
Editorial: the construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen line between Tsuruga and Shin-Osaka, which was scheduled to start in 2023, has been postponed, and this is beginning to have an impact on town development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture.
In Obama City, where the new station will be built, the detailed location of the station is not indicated even now, and city planning, including the development of the surrounding area, has stalled.
It is expected to take a long time to formulate the plan, and it will need to be announced as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station planned for Obama City will be the only new station west of Tsuruga.
In 2019, the Japan Railway Construction and Transportation Facilities Support Organization indicated that the approximate location of the station would be within a radius of about 2.5 kilometers, with JR Higashi-Obama Station at the center.
Detailed station locations and routes were expected to be finalized in the winter of 2022
Obama City will begin full-scale operations related to the Shinkansen in fiscal 2021, with an eye on the opening of Tsuruga Station and the subsequent Obama Station.
In the initial budget for fiscal 2022, they plan to further increase the number of projects and promote town planning in anticipation of announcing the location of the new station.
However, the exact location of the new station is not yet known.
The city has allocated 3 million yen to this year's budget as a project to consider land use and development concepts based on the location of the new station and formulate a basic plan, but it is expected that this will not be implemented.
A city official said that urban planning centered on the new station "takes time to build consensus among citizens."
Echizen City is an example of a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station, but it seems that it will take a considerable amount of time to put together an overall plan.
There is concern that the later the announcement is made, the shorter the preparation period until the opening, and the impact it will have on surrounding infrastructure.
Prior to the location of the new station, there was uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, citizens' groups in Kyoto City along the extension route submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism calling for the cancellation of the extension project.
Ishikawa Prefecture's political circles have noted that the construction of the route has been postponed, and there have been calls to reconsider the Maibara route, and moves have been made one after the other to return the already settled route to its original setting, making it difficult to say that the neighboring prefectures are monolithic.
Obama citizens are relatively calm about the postponement of construction, but there are concerns that the future momentum will be affected if the location of the new station is unknown and the opening date remains unclear.
Mayor Matsuzaki Koji plans to continue making requests to the national government for the early opening of the entire line, but the voices of the areas along the line calling for construction to begin as soon as possible will be indispensable.
The national government and neighboring prefectures cannot move autonomously if they are indifferent to the idea that "the Shinkansen will pass (west of Tsuruga) someday."
I want the enthusiasm to keep speaking out.
Valentine's Day chocolate tasting returns for the first time in three years at Seibu Fukui store in Fukui, Fukui Prefecture, on February 9
In the run-up to Valentine's Day on February 14th, the price of chocolate in stores has risen due to the soaring cost of raw materials and packaging, but sales of high-end "reward chocolates" for oneself and for family and friends are strong.
Retailers and confectionery stores in Fukui Prefecture are trying to attract customers with products that emphasize local colors, luxury, and commitment to ingredients.
The Seibu Fukui store (Fukui City) opened a special sales area on the 6th floor event hall on January 25th.
Until the 14th, about 40 brands and 450 kinds of sweets are on sale, including 10 confectionery stores in the prefecture.
Popular items include chocolates made with local sake from Fukui and sandwiches made with cookies and raw chocolate.
According to the store's representative, in-store prices for many products have increased by about 10% compared to the previous year.
Commenting on this year's trends, he said, "There are many products with distinctive features, such as being particular about the ingredients and adding a sense of luxury to the packaging. as for consumer trends, there is a tendency to buy for yourself or your family and enjoy comparing the tastes."
Even in the face of price hikes, sales of high-end items have been strong.
⇒ Average increase of 25 yen per grain due to high prices
"we are trying to create a place where people can enjoy the Valentine's Day event itself," said the store manager.
In addition to selling daily recommended sweets from January 26th, the store has resumed tasting for the first time in three years.
The Western Confectionery Club (headquartered in Ippondanaka, Maruoka-cho, Sakai City), which manufactures and sells Western confectionery, launched its original "KISEKI" chocolate series for the first time in the Valentine's Day sales season at the end of last year, which was jointly developed with a long-established French chocolate manufacturer.
They are particular about cacao beans and feature a fruity taste with reduced bitterness, and they sell 3 pieces for 1000 yen and 9 pieces for 3000 yen.
Takakura Ryoma, director and general manager of the company's purchasing department, said, "While the culture of giri-choko is gradually fading away, there is demand for people to enjoy a little luxury on Valentine's Day. we will differentiate ourselves by adding value to our products."

A female office worker in her 20s (Fukui City) who visited the Seibu Fukui store on the 9th said, "I've always loved chocolate, so now that I've got a job and can earn money, I want to buy it as a reward for myself."
An office worker in her 30s who bought the chocolate said, "It hurts that the price increase extends to chocolate, but since it's only once a year, I want to give it to my family and the people who usually take care of me. however, the number of people who give it to me may decrease."

The ruins of Ushigahara Castle, said to have been built in preparation for the battle against Heisen-ji Temple (Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture)
The Inuikawa area of Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, was once the site of a large-scale Ushigahara manor.
Ushigahara Castle is said to have been built halfway up Mt. Nabedoko in the district in preparation for a battle with Heisen-ji Temple, which was in conflict with the manor during the Kamakura period.
He appears in the war chronicle "Taiheiki."
There are no documents left about Ushigahara-jo Castle, but in "Echizen Ushigahara Jito Suicide Incident" in volume 11 of Taiheiki, the following is written.
Aikawa Ukyonosuke Tokiharu, an official of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), was dispatched to Ono as jito.
In 1333, the Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto), which was established to monitor the Imperial Court and control the western provinces, was overthrown by Ashikaga Takauji, and the Kamakura Shogunate was further overthrown by Nitta Yoshisada.
When Tokiharu's retainers heard the news that Rokuhara Tandai had been destroyed, they immediately ran away, leaving only about 20 people.
Taking advantage of the situation, monk-soldiers from Heisen-ji Temple attacked.
Tokiharu followed his wife and two children into the river, and then killed himself.
⇒ An impregnable castle where Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu all stood
In 2014, the local residents' group "Inui-san Yoru Yoru Kai" published "Inui-san Historical Story."
Tokiharu's tragic story is introduced in a manga so that even elementary school students can easily understand it.
Kitagawa Masao (75), who was involved in the publication, said, "I want local people to know about the history around them and pass it on to future generations."

Ushigahara Castle
The ruins of the castle can be accessed by a mountain trail maintained by the Inui-side Improvement Society.
It is about 200 meters from the trailhead.
In winter, the road leading to the trailhead may be impassable due to snow.
Association for Improving the Inui Side
About 220 households in the Inui area of Ono City have joined.
In the past, they published "Inui Torisetsu," which introduces the ancient tombs, historic sites, and highlights in the area.
Rennyo no Sato Awara, a roadside station currently under construction in Yoshizaki, Awara City, Fukui Prefecture, will open on April 22.
In anticipation of the opening of Ashihara-Onsen Station on the Hokuriku Shinkansen line in the spring of 2024, it is expected to attract approximately 360,000 users annually as a new regional development and tourism hub for the northern part of the city.
The station's main dining and retail facility is a one-story, steel-framed building with a total floor area of 975 square meters.
The entire site area of the roadside station, including the parking lot and Nagisa Children's Park, is 8,137 square meters.
The facility will also have a rest area and a tourist information center.
Electric bicycles can be rented and there is also a shower room.
The two parking lots will accommodate a total of 66 small and large vehicles (including three for the disabled).
Morinotsugu, mayor of the city, made the announcement at a regular press conference on February 8.
At the food and drink corner, parfaits made with fruit from the Sakai Hokubu Hills and Tomitsu Kintoki pies are on sale.
They are working on developing a menu that uses plenty of local products, such as tamago kake gohan (rice topped with egg) made with Fukujidori chicken, and autumn / winter limited dishes made with eel from Kitakata.
Currently, about 60 businesses are members of the direct sales store's Shippers Council.
There will also be an extensive selection of processed foods such as bento boxes and side dishes, as well as agricultural and garden products such as seedlings and plants.
The souvenir corner displays and sells works by artists residing at the Kanazu Creative Museum, as well as sweets, sake, and traditional crafts.
⇒ "Minami Echizen San Kairi" ranked first in the Kinki region in the Michi No Eki ranking
The station is managed by Awa Running LLC (Yoshizaki 2-chome, Awara-shi), which was established by Miyatani Masashi, president of Tsuki Usagi no Sato, a theme park where visitors can interact with rabbits in Kaga City, Ishikawa Prefecture.
At the press conference, Mayor Mori said, "We will restore and promote vitality and vitality to the entire city of Awara, leading to the improvement of the lives of local residents and the revitalization of the region."
A cat-shaped serving robot introduced at the "Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store."
His adorable expression is said to be popular with family customers (Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture)
In Fukui Prefecture's restaurant industry, which is suffering from a labor shortage, there is a growing movement to introduce robots that deliver food to customers' tables.
In addition to being useful for labor-saving store operations and "contactless" customer service to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the robot's adorable expression is said to be popular with family customers.
Restaurant owners and related parties have said, "It's difficult for restaurants in rural areas to secure employees and part-time workers, and I think food delivery robots will become even more popular."
"Jin, Jin, Genghis Khan!"
While playing light music, a robot with a cat's face displayed on the screen smoothly runs through the store with food on it.
When they arrive at their table, they say to the customer, "I brought the food you ordered."
In August 2022, the "Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store" in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, introduced a cat-shaped serving robot.
When a customer places an order for food on a robot waiting near the kitchen and presses the table number on the screen, it will autonomously drive to that table and deliver it.
It has a built-in AI (artificial intelligence) voice function, reacts when a customer touches it, and the cat's facial expression on the screen is rich.
The Bonta Group, which manages the store and other facilities, has introduced robots to serve meals at two of its stores, including this one.
President Saito Toshiyuki said, "The biggest reason for the introduction is the labor shortage," emphasizing that it is part of productivity improvement through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of personnel costs to store sales is usually around 30%, but it has been reduced to 21-22% with the introduction of the system.
Robots also play a role in collecting dishes that customers have finished eating, leading to more efficient cleanup, and he added, "It's fun for families and children, and it also has a promotional effect."
In August 2022, Rokugen Hoshiyama Fukui Branch, a yakiniku and offal hot pot restaurant in Araki Shinpo-cho, Fukui City, also introduced a robot to serve meals.
Hoshiyama Eifuku, president of Sonsan Shoten, which runs the store, explains how the system was introduced, "Even if we recruit employees or part-time workers, they don't come often. I thought it was absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage."
The Fukui store operates by separating the zones where employees serve food from the robot delivery area.
The lease fee for the robot is said to be about the same as the wage of a part-time worker.
In order to save labor, the store has introduced a tablet-based ordering system in addition to robots, and is also considering self-checkout.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, the effective job openings-to-applicants ratio for December 2022 was 6.94 for "customer service" at restaurants and other establishments, indicating a high labor shortage.
A representative from Internet System (2-chome, Takagi Chuo, Fukui City), which is in charge of sales agents for food delivery robots, said, "Due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the shortage of workers at restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious, and there have been many inquiries regarding the introduction of robots."
President Hoshiyama analyzed, "I think it will become even more difficult for suburban stores in rural areas to secure employees in the future, and I think food delivery robots will become more common."
[editorial] The town of Echizen has created an ending note and is distributing it to townspeople who want it.
Two years ago, he published the "Okuyami Handbook," which covers the procedures required when a relative passes away, as well as a handwritten inheritance list and family tree, and many people came to pick it up for themselves.
Lectures on how to write ending notes and organize one's life are often held in various parts of the prefecture, and it seems that "Shikatsu" has become firmly established among the citizens.
The ending note for Echizen-cho is 35 pages.
The five chapters begin with a review of one's personal history, followed by a description of one's current health and financial situation, future nursing care, hopes for end-of-life care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a section where you can write what you want to do for the rest of your life and a message for your loved ones.
Writing 35 pages can be exhausting, but you don't have to fill every page.
What do you most want to leave behind for your family and those around you?
The important thing is to be clear about your purpose.
Bookstores sell a wide variety of notebooks that suit different purposes, and it's easy to start writing wherever you can.
It was in 2009 that the term "shukatsu" was coined, likening it to job hunting.
Two years later, in 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
It is said that many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly," and that more and more people are preparing for their final moments and end of life.
More than 10 years have passed since then.
The COVID-19 pandemic that has hit the world has not yet subsided.
Prices have risen, in part because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and electricity bills this winter have shot up to unexpected levels.
On the other hand, wages haven't risen enough to match the current high prices, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, in the past, siblings and relatives were able to share funeral expenses, nursing care expenses, and grave management, but now it is not uncommon to have an only child.
In addition, although life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a decade ago, the dilemma is that the risk of dementia and need for long-term care increases as people get older.
It is important to keep in mind that this heightened social anxiety is also behind the fact that the end of life is not a temporary event, but has taken hold.
In any case, we all want to avoid overburdening our partners and children.
"be yourself at the end" seems to be a popular keyword in the ending notes, but you shouldn't be too smug.
I don't want to write down my hopes and requests in secret, but I want to consult with my family at least once and calmly prepare for that time.

At a graduation ceremony on February 10, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture, expressed the view that, in principle, it was not necessary for students and teachers to wear masks
On February 10th, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) established a policy that students should "basically not wear masks" at graduation ceremonies.
A junior high school principal at a large school said, "It's actually difficult to keep a wide distance between students, and I'm worried about how to deal with it. some students are worried about taking off their masks."
The topic has reportedly been brought up among teachers following reports about masks being worn at graduation ceremonies.
On the other hand, an elementary school principal said, "If the government decides, they will not wear it. if it excludes choirs, it may be realistic."
At this year's graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are exploring ways to relax the measures, such as allowing current students who had refrained from attending to participate and allowing graduates to sing together again.
Ceremonies are scheduled for prefectural high schools in early March, and for public elementary and junior high schools in the middle of the month.
The prefectural board of education and municipal boards of education will wait for an official notification from the Ministry of Education before making a decision on how to respond.
There were also cautious voices about the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's decision not to require masks in all school activities from the new semester this spring.
The principal of the elementary school said, "Children will be confused if one day they suddenly decide not to wear a mask. it's natural for more and more children to decide that they are free to wear masks and then gradually remove them."

On February 10th, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided that masks will not be required for school activities from April in line with the government's new guidelines on wearing masks.
In principle, masks will not be worn in choir, physical education classes, or club activities.
During the 2022 academic year, infection control measures will be required in accordance with the current hygiene management manual, and precautions from April onwards will be made known to the Board of Education and school sites.
Even during the 2022 academic year, graduation ceremonies at elementary schools, junior high schools, high schools, and universities will be held with ventilation and other measures in place, and graduates, faculty, staff, and participating current students will not wear masks.
Nagata Yasushi cuts an examinee (left) with scissors while praying for success in exams at Hair Atelier Rim Rim in Tsuka-cho, Echizen, Fukui Prefecture
At Hair Atelier Rim Rim, a beauty salon in Tsuka-cho, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, every year during the entrance exam season, students are cut with scissors and other tools to pray for success in the exam.
It has been well received by prospective students, with comments such as "I feel more confident" and "I was able to approach the exam calmly."
Nagata Yasushi, president of the salon, has seen and heard students open textbooks while waiting for their hair to be cut, and express their anxiety about taking entrance exams while getting their hair cut.
So, in 2014, they began to cut the prayer for passing exams, hoping that it would "help them in some way."
⇒ Last day for national and public university applications
Every year, on the first day of work, the salon asks students to pray for success with scissors and combs at Kamisoja in Wakatake-cho.
Around 80 people get cut every year.
In addition to high school and university entrance exams, there are various employment exams and driver's license examinations.
They present him with a pencil to pray for success in school.

"dear Prime Minister," Breakwater of Life "from Tojinbo," a self-published book by the NPO "Heart-touching Literary Collection and Editorial Office"
"dear Prime Minister" Breakwater of Life "from Tojinbo" I have self-published my 10th book under this title.
Newspapers across the country have picked up the story, and many readers have written about their impressions.
The purpose of publishing this book is to share with you what I have heard directly from suicidal people about the "social and structural" environmental problems that cause suicide in Japan, and to encourage the creation of a "comfortable society."
For 18 years and 10 months, we have been patrolling the rocky shore of Tojinbo in Fukui Prefecture, which is known as a famous suicide spot, to prevent suicide, and continue our support activities until we find, protect, and restart those who have attempted suicide.
This book summarizes the problems we have heard from the 784 people we have protected so far (as of February 6th), and appeals to the Prime Minister on the following 7 points regarding the national measures necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "life-saving" activities.
(2) "Human rights violations" are piling up behind the suicides.
(3) Suicide victims are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Government agencies treat citizens who live outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treat them coldly.
(5) Even if a person with mental illness such as depression is drugged and commits suicide, it is treated as an "accident."
(6) The "duty of care for safety" in areas at high risk of suicide has been forgotten, and commercialism has taken over.
(7) The doctrine of new religious groups that cannot be scientifically proven is deception, and the act of threatening others by telling them of future curses and making them provide money or goods is extortion.
Religious groups that commit this criminal act of "fraud and extortion" should be publicly announced and eliminated.
Therefore, we have received a lot of comments from people who have subscribed to this book, such as "I was impressed by the strong mentality of the people who are working on this activity," "This former police officer is a model among police officers," and "He is a living Bodhisattva who supports others as if they were his own family, even though they are strangers," so here is one of the comments.
When I saw the picture in the newspaper article, tears welled up in my eyes, "What were you thinking..."
I've heard that the number of suicides among people who have been cornered by the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing.
It is really sad.
Everyone should be who they are.
I want our society to be a place where people can enjoy the life they are given.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude for the staff who are giving their all to people who are suffering so much that they want to die.
I understand that this activity is physically and mentally demanding, but please take care of yourself and continue to talk to me.
Thank you very much.
Absolutely.
I hope you, the readers, will also become gatekeepers of life in your communities.

Shimada Kenji, who takes weekly photos of capybaras and posts them on social media, at Happijan, an indoor facility at Asuwayama Park amusement park in Fukui Prefecture, on February 1.
A man in Fukui takes weekly photos of capybaras at Happijan, an indoor facility at the Asuwayama Park amusement park in Fukui Prefecture, and posts them on Instagram.
The post is lined with a variety of thumbnail images, including the moment she yawns with her teeth peeking out of her big mouth, and the moment she lies down and basks in the sun.
He has more than 10,000 followers in Japan and overseas, helping to spread the word about the charms of Happijan and Capybara.
⇒ Kudo Shizuka posts traditional vegetables from Fukui prefecture on Instagram
The man is Shimada Kenji (38), an office worker who lives in the city.
In March 2021, they started posting on social networking sites (SNS).
Capybaras are among the world's largest rats, and they have webbed fingers and are good swimmers.
Since its opening in 2018, Happijan has raised a total of three animals, one male and two female, and you can observe and feed them up close.
Shimada first learned about capybaras five or six years ago.
When he saw the video of them relaxing in the hot spring, he was shocked and said, "What is this animal?"
I was drawn to his charming, human-like expressions and gestures.
After that, I heard that they were going to be bred in Happijan, and I was looking forward to seeing them up close.
I started taking photos in earnest about three years ago when I bought a DSLR camera.
It is used to capture the adorable capybara, and you won't want to miss a chance to take a picture of it shaking its body and draining the water like a drill.
There are about 830 posts on Instagram, and I look back and think, "How dare you take so many pictures?"
Perhaps because he remembered Shimada-san from his frequent visits, the male Yamato-kun came up to him and made a cry, "Kyurukyuru."
Shimada's love for capybaras continues to deepen, saying, "They're cute and I'm so happy."
He also enjoys interacting with capybara lovers across the country through social media, showing off their best shots every month.
Shimada, who also visits zoos in nearby prefectures to see capybaras, said with a smile, "I'd like to continue taking pictures and posting them, mainly of Mt. Asuwa, which is our home."

Toba City seeks return of double child-rearing household benefit - Ise Newspaper
[Toba] The city of Toba announced on the 10th that a total of 600,000 yen was wrongly paid to 12 people in 11 households for the 2021 Special Support Payment for Families with Children (for other households).
The city has said it will apologize to those affected, explain the circumstances, and request procedures for returning the money.
According to the city, it was discovered on January 27, 2023, after being pointed out by the parents of the target child who had confirmed their past payments.
When they checked all 182 people in 79 households eligible for the payment in the same year, they found that the benefits paid on July 20, 2021 had been paid twice to 12 people in 11 households.
The city will provide 50,000 yen per child under high school age as a subsidy to households that are exempt from resident tax.
It said it had received data from a computer company that had been contracted to extract the target children, but that the staff in charge mistakenly thought they did not include high school students and added them to the data, resulting in double payments.
A representative from the city's child-rearing support office said, "We take this matter very seriously, and will take all possible measures to prevent a recurrence, such as rechecking the data, and work to restore trust."

It snows again.
It was not a cold wave coming from the north, but the effect of a low pressure system moving east along the southern coast of the Japanese archipelago.
It's been a short time since we experienced the unusually cold weather of the 24th-26th of last month, and we still can't let our guard down ▼ Even the same cold weather will be even more bearable for the people of the Republic of Turkey, which has been hit by a major earthquake.
The building collapsed in an instant.
Together with neighboring Syria, more than 20,000 people have been killed so far, and many are still left behind in the rubble ▼ The country is known as a pro-Japan country.
It all started in 1890 with the shipwreck of the Ertuğrul, a warship dispatched to Japan by the then Ottoman Empire.
The fact that residents of Kushimoto-cho, Wakayama Prefecture, where the accident took place, helped and cared for the crew has been introduced in movies and novels. ▼ About 100 years after the accident, a Turkish aircraft was dispatched to Iraq to rescue Japanese hostages on the eve of the Gulf War to repay the kindness.
Those who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this suffering.
I want to keep an eye on the situation until it calms down and reconstruction and restoration are complete.

Bellino Hotel receives subsidy illegally, prefecture and city accommodation support project already fully refunded | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Newspaper
On the 10th, the prefecture and Ichinoseki City announced that Bellino Hotel Ichinoseki (Yameme, Ichinoseki) had been using the facility inappropriately for about a year since October 2021, as part of their respective subsidy programs to discount the accommodation prices of travelers.
When people who were not eligible for the discount stayed at the hotel, they were given a discount by lending their name by an employee.
There were also many cases of employees staying overnight that were not in line with the company's business objective of "stimulating tourism demand."
By the 6th of this month, the entire amount of 7,231,000 yen received due to improper use, including voluntary investigations by the prefecture, city, and hotel, had been returned.
Among the fraudulent recipients of subsidies were the Iwate Travel Support Project, an accommodation discount implemented by the prefecture in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus, and the Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount, an emergency measure for tourist accommodation facilities run by the city.
The period is from October 18, 2021 to October 10, 2022 (the Ichinoseki accommodation support discount ends on September 30, 2022), and the results of the investigation showed that 95 inappropriate uses that are not eligible for discounts, such as outside the target area or unvaccinated, amounted to 587,000 yen, and 1,239 uses that are not in line with the purpose and purpose of the project amounted to 6,644,000 yen
When the prefectural contractor was proceeding with the settlement process, it was confirmed that the user of the accommodation discount and the person in charge of reception at the hotel were the same person.
A detailed investigation by the prefecture revealed inappropriate use, and the city, which received this information, confirmed the facts.
The city's project has already ended, and the registration for the prefectural project was deleted on December 2 last year.
In response to the interview, Michiaki Dobashi, president of Bellino, which operates the hotel, said, "I am sorry for the inconvenience caused to the local community, the prefecture and the city, and many people. I regret it very much. the hotel owes its existence to the local community, and I would like to restart from scratch and work to restore trust," and plans to hold another compliance training session for all employees.
Chiba Takahito, director of the promotion section of the prefecture's tourism and promotion office, said, "It is truly regrettable. I would like to encourage compliance with the rules and the establishment of compliance, and call for proper use in line with the purpose of the project."
Mayor Sato Yoshihito issued a comment saying, "It is truly regrettable that there was inappropriate use of the project at an accommodation facility in the city."

Some horses were seen breathing white breath in the cold.
New track lighting will be installed at the racecourse for the 2023 season.
It will be possible to hold twilight events, and after trial lighting, full-scale operation will begin.

New Ramen and Tantanmen on the Menu Only on Thursdays at Roadside Station Kinshuko (Nishiwaga) | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Newspaper
Roadside Station Kinshuko (manager: Masuoka Yuki) in Suginahata, Nishiwaga-cho, will operate a ramen restaurant, Menya Nishiki, on Thursdays only, after previously being closed.
They have newly developed Tantan noodles (850 yen including tax) using locally produced ingredients, so that more people can enjoy the local flavors.
The roadside station's restaurant Kinshuko, which serves dishes such as "Yuda Dam Curry" (1,200 yen) and "Nishiwaga Marugoto Ramen" (900 yen), was closed on Thursdays to secure a day off for staff, but customers said they were disappointed.
In response to this, on the 9th, they started serving only ramen, which can be served by a small number of people.
From the restaurant's menu, they decided to sell only four items: soy sauce ramen, soy sauce chashumen, miso ramen, and miso chashumen, as well as tantan noodles.
Coinciding with the opening of "Menya Nishiki," a new product, Tantanmen, is based on "Yukikko Miso," which is made from Nishiwaga soybeans and sun-salt, and uses locally produced green onions, Nishi-Warabi, minced meat, and chili peppers.
There have been many orders since the first day, and they will consider offering it on days other than Thursdays in the future.
The roadside station will be closed from May 2021 to November 2022 due to the closure of National Route 107.
During this time, he opened an alternative restaurant, "Ramen to Donburi no Mise Nishiki," in Kotsunazawa, and will make use of the know-how he has accumulated.
Manager Masuoka says, "The tantanmen noodles that warm your body are perfect for this time of year. the menu is small, but I want people to feel happy eating delicious food."
In winter, they are open from 11: 00am to 2: 30pm (last order 2: 00pm), just like the restaurant.

An introduction to the pioneers of plant research, including materials collected at Mt.Hayaike, at the Hanamaki City Cultural Heritage Center exhibition | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Newspaper Company
A special exhibition, "The People Who Introduced the Flowers of Hayachine: a Short History of Hayachine Botanical Research," is being held at the City Cultural Heritage Center in Osako-cho, Hanamaki until the 12th, featuring the predecessors who laid the foundation for botanical research on Mt. Hayachine, which is known as a treasure trove of alpine plants.
It collects 124 materials, including valuable specimens collected by predecessors, and introduces the footprints of predecessors who were involved in botanical research on Mt. Hayachine.
Hayachineyama's botanical research began with Russian botanist Karl Johan Maximovich (1827-1991), who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Sugawa Chonosuke (1842-1925) from Shiwa-cho, who collected plants under Maximovich's guidance.
Maximovich, who was not allowed to walk freely in the country because he was a foreigner, asked Sukawa to collect them and continued his research for three years, based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sukawa continued to support Maximovich's research after his return to Japan, leading to the presentation of "Himekozakura," "Nanbutouchiso," and "Miyamayukishoma," which are endemic to Mt. Hayachine.
After that, Makino Tomitaro (1862-1957), a modern plant taxonomist, published "Numbutranoo," "Kobanotsumekusa," and "Numbutinuzuna" in 1903 (Meiji 36), based on the collections of local researchers, and "Katohakobe," which he discovered and named after climbing Mt. Hayachine in 2005 (Meiji 38).
From the materials on display, you can see that many researchers have uncovered valuable alpine plants.
Also introduced were Sugimura Matsunosuke (1874-1948), principal of Hanamaki Elementary School and a plant researcher, who accompanied the survey for the preservation of natural monuments in 1927, and Tamagawa Shichiro (1914-1988), curator of the Osako Town Mountain Museum and involved in the publication of "Hayaikemine's Plants."
Yoshida Sohei, a curator at the center, said, "There is a lot of research and connections between people behind the names of each plant on Mt. Hayachine. we can trace the connections between researchers from rural areas to the rest of the country."
The exhibition is divided into four chapters, with the first focusing on the faith and history of Hayachine, and the second on the geological features of Hayachine, based on surveys conducted by Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundation of Japanese geology.

Even when the ball changed hands, his proud fastball shined.
LOTTE's Sasaki Aki (Ofunato High School) made his debut on the 9th at Ishigaki Camp in Okinawa, pitching 30 pitches in the World Baseball Classic (WBC) and hitting 160kg.
With two hits against six batters, he said with a sense of fulfillment, "I've gained a lot. my forkball is a little better than it was in last year's training game."
The 160km mark was measured twice, and Fujiwara was fouled by a choke and Yasuda by a groundout.
Matsukawa, who received the ball, was impressed with the quality of the finish, saying, "There was a really strong ball coming and the batter was inserted."
Manager Yoshii also seemed satisfied with the steady progress in his fourth year as a pro, saying, "I think it's going well. it's good at this point."
As the next step, he will pitch in a practice match against Yakult (Itoman, Okinawa) on the 15th, throwing around 40 pitches.
"I want to be able to produce more straight ball accuracy and overall cohesion," he said, delving into the details.
Idlib district in northwest Syria, damaged by the major earthquake, early on the morning of the 9th (photo provided by local residents / Kyodo News)
Gaziantep, southern Turkey (Kyodo News) - The confirmed death toll from a major earthquake centered in southern Turkey surpassed 21,000 in both countries on the 9th, according to authorities in the affected country and neighboring Syria.
Rescuing survivors from collapsed buildings and other structures in the bitter cold has become more difficult over time.
Desperate searches were underway in the affected areas.
The UN on the 9th brought supplies through the Turkish border to the affected province of Idlib in northwest Syria for the first time since the earthquake struck on the 6th.
Idlib governorate is the last stronghold of the opposition against the Assad regime in Syria's civil war, and there were fears international aid might not reach there.
Rescue efforts, including the use of heavy machinery, continue at disaster sites in both countries, but they are facing difficulties.
The death toll is likely to rise further as many people remain buried in the rubble.
Turkish authorities have confirmed 17,674 deaths in the country.
Combined with more than 3,000 Syrian deaths, it is more devastating than the 1999 earthquake in northwestern Turkey that killed more than 17,000 people.
Miyako City plans to implement its own support measures to subsidize energy costs such as electricity, gas and gasoline for businesses in the city that are struggling to secure profits due to soaring fuel and commodity prices.
As an emergency measure, it will invest its own financial resources to support the local economy, which is in a difficult situation.
Businesses in all industries are eligible (excluding farmers, fishermen, and electricity and gas supply companies).
The profit margin for the most recently ended fiscal year must be lower than that of the previous year.
The subsidy will cover half of the increase in expenses for six consecutive months between April 2022 and March 2023 compared to the same period of the previous year, with a maximum of 1 million yen per business.
Approximately 800 people are expected to receive benefits.

The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has set an overall goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at each airport by 46% or more by 2030 (compared to 2013), with the aim of achieving zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and becoming "carbon neutral."
In response to this, the council held its first meeting in November last year and is aiming to formulate a plan ahead of the other six outlying airports in the prefecture.
As with the first meeting, the second meeting was closed to the public except at the beginning.
According to Chairman Ando, who was interviewed after the meeting, the airport's greenhouse gas emissions were confirmed at the meeting.
Discussions were held in line with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism's guidelines in order to set targets and introduce renewable energy.
According to the handout, the standard CO2 emissions from the airport's facilities and vehicles in fiscal 2013 were 1,476 tons (excluding aircraft).
Of this, emissions from lighting and air conditioning at seven facilities, including the airport terminal building, accounted for 1,321 tons, or about 90%, followed by aviation lights at 84 tons and airport vehicles at 71 tons.
The council will proceed with discussions on reducing emissions from these facilities and vehicles.
Chairman Ando said, "This is a milestone. the direction of the committee members is the same, and I would like to put together a solid interim report first."
After hearing opinions on the interim report at the third meeting and the final report at the fourth meeting, a promotion plan will be formulated.
Okinoerabu branch of "Sakasama Real Estate" opens to attract people to the island People who want to rent houses are looking for landlords | Society and Economy | Nankai Nichinichi Newspaper
Opening event held on the 8th to deepen understanding of "Sakasama Real Estate" through talk sessions, etc. in Chinacho
[Okinoerabu General Affairs Bureau] On the 8th, the opening event of the Okinoerabu branch of the real estate web service "Sakasama Real Estate," which visualizes the thoughts of people who want to rent vacant houses and vacant stores and recruits landlords, was held at the community space "entaku" in China-cho, China.
Through a talk session, the operating company explained the outline of the service.
Okubo Masahiro, representative director of Tsugi Nova (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), which is in charge of managing the branch office, said, "By carrying out this initiative on Okinoerabu-jima, we hope to create a movement and trend that will attract people to the entire island."
Upside-down real estate is the opposite of normal real estate procedures, where the information of the person who wants to rent is disclosed, the lender contacts them, and if an agreement is reached, they sign a contract themselves.
Operated by On-Co Co., Ltd. (headquarters: Mie Prefecture), the service was launched in June 2020 as a demonstration experiment to discover potential vacant houses and build relationships through them.
This is the seventh branch office to be opened and the first in Kyushu.
It is the first of its kind on a remote island in Japan.
About 20 people participated in the event, including staff from On-Co and Tsuginova, town hall officials from Wadomari and China, and local residents.
Representative Director Okubo explained the background to the opening of the branch office, saying, "With the movement to attract people from outside the island gaining momentum, I thought that if we could make use of vacant houses and stores, the town and the island would become even more vibrant."
He said, "I want to connect with people who have properties on the island and people who want to do something, and help as many of them as possible move forward with their efforts."
Mizutani Takeshi, CEO of On-Co, pointed out the points to keep in mind when running the facility, saying, "We need to take care of each vacant house, and discuss what the locals want to do with the area, what kind of people they want to attract, and what criteria they will use to choose."
"the deeper the connection between people, the more information will be gathered," he said, calling on islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

I think I would have appreciated it a little more if the thick coating hadn't crushed each mold and detail.
Do you have a Mercari Merccard?
I don't think Mercari is very convenient because the money you sell is used for purchases.
I went through the procedure with the aim of getting the first bonus...
I haven't used it yet.
I don't think the items listed will be cheaper yet...
Are there any promotions where you can get a discount when using the card?
Does the NSR250R blink when the key is turned on and the blinker is operated without the engine running?
If the battery is normal, when the key is turned on, the ACC, that is, the accessories, are energized, so the blinkers and brake lights are on.
The horn will be there too.
However, after the engine is started, the voltage rises, so I feel better.
Can ADATA DDR4 and Samsung DDR4 be mixed?
It is a laptop.
In principle, they can be used together if the pin arrangement, voltage, frequency, and other specifications match.
If it's just a difference in frequency, it's also designed to work with the slower one, but that doesn't mean it's absolutely okay because some things may not work well.
If you're going to serve customers sleepy in the morning, shouldn't you go to bed earlier the day before?

I want to play an mp4 file "from one place to another" repeatedly, is there any free software available?
Or can I do it with the software that comes with Windows 10?

However, it is not possible to memorize the interval between A and B, so it must be specified every time
I am riding a 1999 17 Crown Estate.
It is a 1J turbo.
I'm considering replacing my R154 with an MT, how much will it cost including the mission fee??
If you know more, please give me some advice.
Are you ignoring the harness, controls, settings, everything?
Maybe 300,000 yen then?
I think we should prepare about 1 million yen separately though.
I've got fat around my belly and hips, does it make me look fat?
My upper body feels like a middle-aged, fat belly that I often see, but my lower body feels huge!
If you look at it as a whole, it seems to make a pretty big impression.
My nephew was surfing the internet and apparently came across something like this, is it okay if I give it my all?
If you haven't entered anything from here, you can ignore it because it's a lie that you were registered.
Is this thinning hair?
It is a "crack" in the hair caused by the hairstyle.
If you continue to do this kind of hairstyle, be careful because if you comb or brush incorrectly, you will tend to thin your hair.
It's hard to get thinning hair if you don't comb it the wrong way though.
If you don't like your scalp being visible, you can solve the problem by changing your hair style to one that won't split.
Is this Dunhill purse real?
If it was purchased at a famous department store such as Takashimaya, it would come with a warranty, so it can definitely be said to be genuine, but isn't that the case??
A present or something!?
If in doubt, ask your local pawnshop or brand-name retailer to appraise it.
Didn't the inexperienced club advisor do any club activities when he was a student?
If you have no experience as a club advisor, it is because there is no one else who has experience (including those who are already in charge of other club advisors), and it does not necessarily mean that you have not been involved in a club when you were a student.
I'm a high school student.
It's been getting colder recently, so I've started wearing black stockings, but is it still too early?
You can wear them if you feel cold.
You don't have to wear it at the same time as others.
If that makes you sick, you'll never have children.
At night, my legs and feet are so itchy that I can't sleep.
Why are my legs and feet so itchy at night?
Maybe there are ticks.
It's a good idea to hang your futon out to dry occasionally.
Why is it said that if it has a structure less than 1 / 20th of the wavelength, it can be approximated as a continuous medium?

Godiva is good.
It's a little expensive, but there are some very simple chocolates, so I recommend them.
Do you live alone?
Are you having any fun?
I lived alone.
Until last year.
It was fun.
Humans are used to being animals, so if we continue to have fun every day, that state becomes normal.
If fun becomes routine, you won't think of it as "fun" unless there's more fun.
I understand that, which is why I enjoy "everyday life without anything."
That's what I feel.
Would you like a cup of yakisoba with plenty of tenkasu on top?

It can be used for soba or udon noodles, but it can also be used in takoyaki and okonomiyaki.
If I paint stainless steel with paint spray, will it make it difficult for magnets to stick?
Yes, it depends on the magnetic force.
Or rather, as No1 wrote, stainless steel doesn't have magnets, so it's probably low-purity stainless steel mixed with iron.
It's a common story with Chinese fake stainless steel.

Has anyone changed the middle of the first half to the second half specifications?
How much did it cost?
Also, what other effects did it have besides the lights?
If anyone knows more, please let me know.
It is generally cheaper to buy the later version.
Good evening.
Thank you for your answer.
I think of computers as games and cartoons.
I don't find it funny.

Family and friends are the best!

Chinese soba noodles at a diner in the old town!
Any restaurant that serves rice bowls, udon noodles, soba noodles, etc. is OK.
I like that kind of ramen too.
Hida-Takayama ramen and Kitakata ramen are light varieties.
I'm going to an interview for a part-time job at a supermarket tomorrow.

• Travel time from home to work.
• Transportation expenses
・ Whether you have experience working part-time
Why did you choose this workplace?
・ The days and times of the week that you will be on shift
I think this is the least they'll ask!

It will be a civil law, not a constitution.
Have you ever been infected with the flu in your life?
Did it take you a long time?
As for myself, I forget the old days, maybe a few times?
I think so.
I don't remember being infected with the flu for more than 50 years since I started working, but five or six years ago, I had my antibody level measured by the city, and it was sufficient.
I also didn't remember getting vaccinated, but I think I probably got the flu without knowing it and developed antibodies without knowing it.

Beginners are of course welcome in some places.

There is no doubt that the atmosphere was much more fashionable than it is now.
It was a while ago, but I've been worried about it for a long time, so please help me.
I was hospitalized to have surgery for an enlarged prostate, but since I was in the hospital for two months, I had little benefit from the expensive medical care system.

Does it take days for lymph nodes to heal once they are swollen?
I think it depends on what caused the swelling

Manga is only possible when it is accompanied by drawing ability.
You won't pick it up when you're not good at drawing.

Maybe we can work together to find ways to make better frozen foods.

Does the outdoor unit not turn on when the air conditioner is blowing?
How do you get the wind?
With the power of the indoor unit fan, air is sucked in through the indoor unit's air intake and exhaled through the indoor unit's air outlet.

If you know of any good ones, please let me know!

Training

If you train with depleted energy (empty stomach), you will lose muscle
Consuming nutrition (mainly protein) after training helps muscles grow

If you apply mascara first, to put it simply, it will stick and feel firm, so if you curl it, it will be easy to fix.
It is beautiful if you divide it into 3 stages.
Please tell us about some useful items that you wish you had done earlier in your life.

As shown in the picture, is the AKB48 team 8's costume from Odaiba United States 2013?
Do you also wear it on the 8th?
There was a photo of Odaiba United States 2013 in the same outfit, so I guess that's true.
I didn't even know if I was going to wear it on the 8th.
I want to know your favorite soba and udon noodles
Soba is Zaru-soba.
I also like Tororo soba noodles.
The udon noodles are tempura udon.
Perhaps because I'm poor, shrimp tempura udon is a real treat.
He's too persistent.

It will be over soon.
I've been to several different dentists, and when I'm sitting in that practice chair, there's a doctor or dental hygienist talking to me from behind, slightly obliquely.
I'm not sure if it's better to look backwards, but it's hard to keep looking backwards because of your posture, but I also think it's rude if you keep looking forward.
Does anyone know?
How's it going?
Not only at the dentist, but also at the barber and perm shop, they talk face to face.
Which material is cooler, polyester 100 or dry rayon?
Dry rayon is better and cooler

When you go to the tax office to submit your tax return, you don't have to print it out in color, right?
Yes, sir
When will the amount I applied for in the tax return at the beginning of the year be transferred to my account?
I expect the money to be transferred in a couple weeks.
You will receive a postcard informing you that you will be transferring money by postcard first, so please sign your passbook when it comes, because it has been transferred.
For now, I just have to wait for the postcard (notification).

Can I use my VISA LINE PAY prepaid card to purchase a ticketless express ticket with E5489?
Good evening
The "ticketless express ticket" for JR West's "e5489" must be paid for with a credit card.
Prepaid cards cannot be used.
It's been a long time, do you think it's okay?
This is vegetable juice.
It also depends on how you store it.
If it's been in the fridge for a long time, you can drink it after a couple of days, but if it's been left outside or at room temperature, I think you should dispose of it.
If something happens to your body later, it's going to be tough.

About Instagram
I (an ordinary person) currently have about 10,000 followers, but if someone who doesn't know this sees it, do you think it's amazing?
Or do you not think anything about it?
What is it like?
I think it's incredible.
For the average person, it's a miracle.
I think he was doing something special.
Frustrated with the problems
I don't have much time to exercise, so I decided to rely on the trendy pressurized innerwear and bought this.
My body size is H175m W80kg I bought a L size.
It's pretty hard at first to wear it, but once you get used to it, I think you'll be fine.
I've been using it for a few days, but now I'm using another pressure inner because of a problem.
The problem is 1. if the area around the arm is not very thin, the tightness around the edge of the sleeve (just the upper arm) will be too tight, causing a little congestion, and it will be itchy.
2. the lower abdomen is loose I stopped using it because of the above 2 problems.
It's pretty tight in terms of comfort, but there's no problem sleeping with it on.
Great value for money for those who fit
Even at 158cm and 50kg, S was fine.
But it didn't suit me because I have a big frame and am muscular.
Since it is not a three-dimensional structure such as the buttocks, it is easy to make strange gaps and fall down, so it does not fit well.
I always felt like I had to pull myself up.
I think it's good for someone with a stick-like body shape.
Is it safe to say it's thin in terms of thickness?
I was able to boot in tight knee-high boots that didn't feel like they were going to rip or break, and I was able to feel refreshed.
It's lovely.
For the upper body, I didn't want to expose too much skin, but I was looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit and came across it.
The top is fashionable with a braided back and a one-point mark on the hem
I'm glad that I can choose to wear a bikini underneath or shorts above it in two ways (^ ^).
It's just arrived, I tried it on and it hasn't been in the water, so I don't know how durable it is or what it will look like when it gets wet, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is solid, and I thought it was a bargain at this price.
It said there was no wire on the bust, but when I touched it, there seems to be a hard core at the bottom of the pad.
However, it doesn't hurt when I wear it, and it follows my bust properly, so I think it looks great when I move.
Did you change the model from no putts to yes?
(^
I'm looking forward to going into the water now ♪ Thank you very much ♪
Slightly large at 45kg 156cm M size.
The raincoat is made of thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid, but I think it can be used for a long time because the manufacturing method is solid.
It came with two rain visors to keep my face from getting wet.
There was no problem with the strength, and I was able to safely use it on my bike in a storm.
It didn't break after use.
I carry it compactly in a compression bag.
It really exceeded my expectations at this price.
I was able to put it on safely.
It was installed on CLA 180 Shooting Brake in 2016.
Even an amateur can wear it if you read the instructions on YouTube.
Be careful, if you loosen the torque screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
I dropped one and it went missing.
Also, if you pinch the gray connector between the brown and red-green wiring and use a tapered tip such as radio pliers, the force will not be evenly applied and the plastic will break as shown in the photo, making it impossible to attach.
When I called support, they mailed me a new cable the next day and they are a very supportive company.
When I tried again, I used the wide pliers shown in the picture in the instruction manual to squeeze in all at once and it worked well.
When I put the last main unit back in the car, it took a little effort to store the wiring, but I managed to install it.
After installation, I can watch DVD, TV, and navigation while driving without any problems.
It costs over 80,000 yen to order from a dealer, and over 40,000 yen at a specialty store, so I think it's a very cost-effective product.
Below the price
To be honest, I don't know why it's so highly rated. first of all, the cotton inside is poly, but it's cut in the cushion and there are fluffy and scuffy areas. it looks like it's already worn out, or rather, there's not much cotton overall, and after trying it out, I think that if you don't try a product that has the head and body pillow integrated, it may or may not fit you.
It's neither good nor bad
The item has arrived.
I was able to use it immediately.
There is no problem with the feeling of use and I can pump my milk properly.
However, there are times when I find the sound a little annoying and the power button is not responsive.
I don't care because I can use it without any problems, but people who care might.
It's not super quiet 😅 If you use it at night, you might have to be a little careful.
Also, I was worried that the part that connects the included tube to the machine would get into the tube, but I pushed it in 😂 It's lightweight so I think it's easy to carry!
You need a trick to lather it up...
I'm not sure if it's the worst compatibility with my hair type or if it's a performance issue with this shampoo, but it doesn't lather up at all in normal use.
(the shampoo I've been using so far lathers up without a problem even when used normally) So here's the solution I found ↓ 1 First, pick up a smaller amount of shampoo than usual and apply it to the entire hair.
(at this point, no lather will appear at all) 2Rinse your hair once, then pick up a suitable amount of shampoo and let it blend into your hair.
(it finally lathers up normally) Well, in short, it's a double wash lol The volume of the shampoo itself is quite small, so the trick is to use as little shampoo as possible the first time... I'm satisfied with the effect of the shampoo itself.
It's obvious that I bought this expensive shampoo, but I clearly felt that my hair felt better.
However, my honest impression is that I was not satisfied with the overall review.
It's a shame because I've been using the Quattro Botanico series for facial cleansing products.
Even though the capacity is small, it's not cost effective because you have to wash it twice.
In addition, in consideration of the scent that may not be popular with everyone, I will give it 2 stars here.
It's hard to assess
There are negatives and positives, and it is difficult to evaluate.
The blade cleaner only cleans the front side of the blade.
I think it matches well with razors that have a good blade accuracy.
Positive: removes dirt from the blade, such as sebum and soap residue, as intended.
(only on the front side) If the dirt makes it less sharp, it will last a long time.
Negative: the life of the smoother is drastically reduced.
Coatings on the cutting edge, such as titanium coating or ceramic coating, can easily peel off.
(after shaving about 2-3 times, most of the coating will come off, so I recommend using this cleaner afterwards.)
Be careful with razors that say not to wipe the edge of the blade.
I wonder if it's cost-effective because it can be used as a substitute for fall prevention rubber (vibration-proof rubber) that can be placed under furniture and other items to prepare for earthquakes.
* The life of the razor I use has increased by 20-30%.
It's difficult to judge when a razor blade is thrown away, but I think it's when shaving causes damage to the blade and the edge becomes ragged.
In that sense, I think it's a good product because it prevents the sharpness from going down due to dirt.
(it's just a cleaner and doesn't have the effect of sharpening. sometimes it feels like it's being sharpened, but that's probably because a little rust has been removed.)
I got caught up in a tv commercial.
I bought it after seeing a TV commercial where an elderly woman's face was lifted up after just applying it once.
When I actually used it, the texture was slightly firmer than normal gel, and I wiped it off with a pre-lotion before using it.
At first, it feels sticky and unpleasant, but when you apply it while massaging it in, it unexpectedly gets into your skin.
After entering, it was almost non-sticky, and my skin felt like it was sticking to my hand.
The lift up didn't work as well as on the TV.
I felt the firmness all at once.
I have super dry skin, so this alone isn't enough, so I've been using it since I used a certain Moisture Surge 72 before.
It just feels hydrating.
I was hoping it would cover loose pores, but it doesn't.
I'd like to try a bottle to see if it works, and if it does, I think I might buy a lip balm.
It must have been hard to put it all together...
It is an effort to look back on what politicians have said over the past few years.
As I read it, I somehow get the sense that what he said at the time was after all true.
However, when considering its value as a reading material, it is difficult to say whether "fact checking," as the authors call it, is enough.
To be honest, it's not interesting to read.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the major flaw in this book was the "method."
Ultimately, no one knows if what we call "fact" here will be true forever.
Judging from the way they wrote it, I felt it was quite suspicious whether they were aware of the fragility (or falsifiability) of "fact checking."
When it comes to the current level of awareness of "facts" among Japanese journalists, I feel a bit gloomy.
It seems like a lot of people recommend it, but it might suit someone who wants some knowledge of what the book covers.
If you, like the reviewer, are interested in the "fact-checking" carried out by the current Japanese media, this book may not be for you.
For those who can't improve their scores on the mock exam.
At my school, politics and economics were printed and taught in a class format that made me feel like I was being forced to study, which was really boring, and before I knew it, I hated politics and economics.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
He is currently in his 3rd year of high school and is currently at the center.
I bought it in March and chose it as my study partner for an hour on the way to and from school.
First impressions are simple to understand.
You've reached the realm of God.
When I finished one lap and took the past exam, I was 70, the average being 40 at the time.
I was surprised myself.
It stretches to the point where you feel like you ate something weird.
What you get from this reference book is not only knowledge and information about politics and economics, but also your own ability and motivation to study I was able to feel firsthand that it was synergistically increasing.
Thank you so much for giving me the chance to meet you.
Crime prevention
I experienced two attempts at door picking eight years ago, and I have been working on crime prevention.
This is a replacement for the camera I bought 8 years ago.
Previously, we used a 30m infrared irradiation type (from another company).
Someone else wrote that this product can recognize faces at night at a distance of about 5m.
I agree with you.
I just arrived and haven't set it up yet, but I'm at the stage of comparing how the camera looks and checking for problems.
The image quality is much better than the camera of 8 years ago (of course).
I displayed it in four sections on a 32-inch monitor, but there is no problem if the shooting size is maximized.
So far, there are no problems with the product.
If you are considering a level of facial recognition other than crime prevention, you may be dissatisfied with night photography in particular, but at this price, it's the best!
I use it for crime prevention, but I don't require facial recognition.
Because you wouldn't know if you were masked (especially at night).
Professional burglars have knowledge of security cameras.
Even though it is small, it can distinguish between a high-performance camera and video recording.
On the other hand, if you're not a pro, you're in trouble.
However, burglars these days are bold and clever, so don't just rely on cameras, I recommend using them in combination with a variety of security products.
For example, there are white solar LED garden lights available at hardware stores for about 1,500 yen (the latest ones are very bright, with six units).
It's solar, so you don't need to pay for electricity, but in winter, it doesn't turn on until morning, so there are also three 100V motion-sensitive LED sensor lights installed.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30m from which we could recognize people.
Also, for daytime crime prevention, if you think that the small size of the camera will make it less intimidating, I think you need to devise a cover.
I have a sticker that says "24 hour security camera active."
It is an original product from a security camera manufacturer that I used before.
The manufacturer's products are more effective than those sold at hardware stores.
The place to put it is an entryway for thieves that cannot be covered by a camera.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
At the same time, the instruction manual for setting up the internet is difficult to understand, so I gave it a minus.
If there are any deficiencies after setting up, I will add them.
So much empathy that it's painful to read
If you were born in 1982 in Japan, your social situation may be slightly better than hers, but even with the enforcement of the Equal Employment Opportunity Law, the situation is still far from equal.
As I read on, painful memories of living through discrimination as a member of society came flooding back, and I felt suffocated.
It depicts the suffering of not only Korean and Japanese women, but all women who try to live as human beings rather than as women in a feudal society.
Isn't it time for women to at least stop this emotional conflict and stand shoulder to shoulder with society?
A drama that makes you think men are the worst
It tells the story of a protagonist who was sexually abused by his biological father as a child.
Of course, even as an adult, the scars continue to drag on.
The men who appear are all the worst.
The main character's husband, who seems gentle and family-oriented, is also the worst in some ways.
There are spoilers ↓ Even though the protagonist's sister knows that her husband is suffering from domestic violence, she ignores it, and even though her sister-in-law finally mustered up the courage to come to the police to sue her husband, the protagonist's husband, who is a police officer, lets it go, which is a frustrating development for men.
The protagonist's elderly mother, who pretends to be dumb, knows that her husband (the protagonist's biological father) was murdered by her daughter, but she doesn't know that (officially, the biological father's death was a drug overdose).
In short, it seems that after the rapist's death, he did not let his daughter receive counseling, so it is natural for the protagonist to go crazy.
Why would the protagonist's daughter want to ask about her dead grandfather?
Do you care about that old man who died so young?
In the drama? too much.
A few years ago, in the summer when a heat wave hit France, many elderly people died, and when hospitals and institutions contacted their daughters and sons, many French people said they couldn't take them in because they were on vacation, and it was reported that the morgues in Paris were full.
These people are "dry."
When I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that they were "dry."
French ones are completely different from American ones, and there are many ambiguous parts that give a good aftertaste, but there were relatively many scenes that I thought should be cut, and I watched them fast forward.
Professional boundaries
If someone's life was at stake due to a precise calculation and an unexpected accident that could not be read, he would have been prepared to risk his life, even if he had calculated it from the beginning to some extent.
The script was brilliant, embodying the subtle emotional drama of how she struggles with her own struggles that she doesn't show in public, and how far she will go to deceive those around her in order to maintain her own beliefs.
Even with that... Jessica's acting is absolutely amazing.
No matter what you look at, you can't go wrong.
It's the work of a professional.
Feeling of use, then it broke down
I've used 3 so far, and this one broke in no time, for better or worse.
The reason I chose this product was because I used the first 2200mA built-in vaporizer, but the battery ran out after 3 sessions at 200 degrees for 5 minutes.
The second USB port is defective.
It cannot be recharged.
This time, this product was designed to solve a problem, but after about 15 times of re-inserting the battery (I used the battery as a charger so that the USB terminal wouldn't break), the connection became bad and it became difficult to turn on.
Press the lid to turn the power on.
If you are an Aikos user, I'm sure some of you have some experience.
That's the symptom.
As noted in the instruction manual, batteries other than the ones included are not used.
The claws and catch part look like they've been carved out, so there seems to be no bending.
Therefore, it was returned within about 10 days.
I bought it without the Starry logo when I returned it, and here's a comparison.
They look the same size.
The same goes for chambers and draws.
LCD: this one is prettier.
It might be newer than no logo.
Vibe This one is modest.
It's just like a smartphone vibrator.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibrator or sound is loud.
Cheap Chinese smartphones.
This product is also Chinese...
The attachments are slightly different.
This one comes with a liquid case.
Without the logo, it looks like a lump of steel wool.
It's roughly like that.
I think Starry would have been better, but if it breaks down quickly, it loses credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I could only choose to return it, so I went ahead with the procedure, although it was troublesome.
It's just ear rubber, but ear rubber
This flat rubber really doesn't hurt.
It's the best mask of its kind I've ever used in terms of comfort.
Even with flat rubber, it can be twisted and the hem of the twist rubs against the base of the ear, causing more pain than round rubber, but I think this product is not only soft to the touch, but also has a length that is just right to prevent twisting.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is good, and not only does it fit, but there is a reasonable amount of space between the nose wire and the lower part of the chin (in front of the mouth), so you don't feel stuffy.
Maybe it's because it fits the dimensions of your face.
I don't know if it suits everyone the same, but if you think any of the other smaller sizes aren't good enough, I think you should give it a try.
When I opened the outer box, it was in plastic with a central slit like a tissue box, but when I took out the first one, the ear elastics on both sides got caught and it was difficult to take out, so I reduced the stars by one star.
The contractor's response was 1 star
The price and taste are perfect, but I was distrustful of the response of the vendor who ignored it and sent it even though I specified the date.
I bought other drinks in bulk besides this product.
I always buy from Amazon, so I know the delivery guy.
I tried to match the arrival date as much as possible, especially since they carry heavy items up to the top, but it was ruined.
Shipping companies are having a hard time because of Amazon, but I'm thinking that there's one thing I can do to help users.
I am disappointed with the arrogant response of the vendor.
But the price is cheap.
If you're considering buying one, include the disposal cost
There are many complaints and I don't think I can use it for a long time.
I think it's a good idea to consider the cost of disposal.
For reference, some local governments have centers that accept bulky waste for free or at a low cost if you bring it in.
[seating comfort] The seat tilts slightly to the left and becomes even more wobbly, so it's very tiring to sit on.
If it moves even a little bit, it will make a loud noise.
It's too noisy to use at night.
This is my biggest concern, and I feel like I can't continue using it.
[assembly] The assembly instructions are rough illustrations only.
Information required for assembly is lacking, and there are many errors.
・ There is no explanation about the orientation when installing the seat and support base Some reviews say that it tilts forward, but there is a possibility that the orientation when installing the seat and support base is the opposite.
When installed correctly, the height adjustment lever is facing backwards on the right hand side, and the dial for adjusting the spring on the back is facing forward.
However, since the height adjustment lever is more natural when facing forward, many people will install it incorrectly.
There are no such basic precautions in the instruction manual, and you have to assemble it through trial and error while looking at rough pictures.
Incorrect description of contents The contents list at the beginning of the manual is incorrect.
It seems that many buyers search for the 8x20mm screws that come with the 12 screws because they can't find them.
The 8x20mm screw is already inserted into the chair, so be careful not to look for it unnecessarily.
It seems that there are combinations where the same screw holes and screws can be inserted and combinations where they cannot be inserted, due to the low precision of the construction.
In some combinations, it is very difficult just to insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that they are shipped with the screws inserted like this.
I also couldn't find the spare screw in the instructions.
[other] The black part on the surface of the vinyl leather has uneven coloring and is whitish in places, so don't expect something as beautiful as the product photo.
An explanation of the inadequacies in the instruction manual and a supplementary explanation of the above installation method were sent to the email address registered with amazon two to three days after the product arrived.
These should have been sent out immediately after the item was shipped.
Many buyers have completed the assembly within 2-3 days of receiving the item, so it is a completely meaningless act.
Hmmm...
I'm a big Thermos fan and have been using the Thermos straw type for over 15 years, but this model is by far the most difficult to use.
(1) The drinking part of the straw is made of a harder material than before, and the groove fits snugly into the body, so the drinking part of the straw can no longer be removed from the body!
I tried desperately to get it off, but my nails cracked...
(2) Only the tip of the mouth of the straw is thinner than before, and the straw brush can no longer be inserted.
(3) The mysterious valve at the end of the straw is thicker than a straw brush, making it dramatically harder to wash.
I'm a bit shocked because I've never had any complaints about using the straw type so far.
It's really stressful not being able to remove the spout from the body.
The good thing is that it still has the same outstanding cooling capacity.
When I forget to take it out of my bag and wash it the next day, about 50% of the ice I put in the day before still remains.
I don't drink hot, so I will continue to be a straw type.
Thank you for the improvements on the next model.
My first review (with additional photos)
This is the first time I will review it.
(this is the impression of an amateur who bought a doll from scratch for the first time and has little knowledge of wearing doll eyes for the first time) The product arrived exactly as pictured.
When I attached it to my Obitsu Doll, it was very cute and had a lot of light, so I was satisfied.
However, when you put it on (at the entrance), it's a little hard and you have to push it in with force.
I think the method is different, but I put tweezers in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About shipping It was my first time shipping from overseas, so I expected it to take about 3 weeks, but it arrived on the 8th (near Narita Airport), earlier than I expected.
However, I was worried because the shipping email was never sent.
I looked at Amazon's shipping description earlier and it says it's still shipping.
There was no damage, no air in my eyes, and there was a lot of bubble wrap on the back of the envelope and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it's safe.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is my personal information okay even though it's a mail from overseas?
I have doubts, so I'll give it a minus 1.
I think the product is a great bargain for that price and amount without any problems.
PostScript Doll Eye 8mm model iPhonese
It's a little small (working area is small), and it's heavily charged
I ordered it after looking at the size notation, but it felt about two times smaller than I had imagined.
Although it is larger than the A4 size, the outer circumference is grooved for parts stock, so the range that can be used for work is narrower than the A4.
I was planning to use it for repairing electronic devices and making Gundam models, but it's hard to use without a B4 size.
If you only use it for soldering iron work and use a separate tray or mat for other work such as assembly and disassembly, you might be able to manage.
It's impossible to place tools, place parts, and do more work within an area the size of a magazine.
I thought about ordering another one of the same ones to double the area, but I think it would be tough to keep using it for a while because the charge is so bad during the work that all the dust and cut parts get sucked up.
Fatal defect
After struggling to open the lid of the battery box, I finally opened it using a rubber anti-slip sheet, but when I tried to load the battery and close it, it wouldn't close.
At this point you are out.
High rating!
Does the lid of the battery box close???
I should add that instead of a protective seal on the product, there was a small sticky plastic wrap attached.
Is this by any chance a secondhand item???
The only explanation was in English, written on a small piece of paper.
There is no illustrated explanation and I don't know how to operate it at all.
Maybe it could be another finger...
I found a great product!
I bought it immediately.
I use it for pinky rings, so if I don't use it a lot, it won't fit perfectly, and it's a little lumpy...
But I think it's great for other fingers.
But I think he is a good idea merchant.
For the price
After all, you shouldn't expect quality from this kind of product.
One of the flower marks was crushed.
I tried it on and the size is just right.
It may be tough for people with thick earlobes.
I could have just bought a patternless one.
Oh, crap.
The design is good, but it's big when you put it on your hand. I wonder if the effect will fade when you put it on your feet?
In the middle of winter in eastern Hokkaido...
As mentioned in other reviews, the heating wire is only 110 × 80, and the layout is not vertical, but horizontal.
I bought it because I wanted to heat the whole futon evenly, so it's more expensive than the bedding type, but it's better if it's bigger, but I can't help it because I can't check it at the store like the famous manufacturers do.
There is no choice but to use it in combination with a hot water bottle and N-Warm.
By the way, the quality of the blankets is out of the question.
It's well done
It is small and has plenty of airflow.
Batteries can also be replaced with spares.
If you place it on a desk and adjust the angle, it will look good as shown in the picture.
If it is on a slippery desk, it will be blown away by your own wind power, but if you put a handkerchief on it, there is no problem.
If you use it outside or at a family restaurant, you won't notice the sound even if it's "inside," but in the office, even if it's "small," it won't be loud.
It is necessary to consider it as a companion when going out.
Also, even if it is "small" for office use, there is too much airflow and it gets too cold.
It is ideal for scenes where you sweat a lot on the road, run to a family restaurant, and cool down all at once with a "big" drink.
The only thing is that on rare occasions when I throw it in my bag, the power button is pressed and it keeps spinning without me knowing.
It would be nice to have some ingenuity such as slightly retracting (sinking) the button or making the first press weak by holding it down.
It's an essential item in times of extreme heat when life is in danger, so it would be helpful if they could make something better.
Multifunctional light speaker
I use the weakest warm color and put it in my bedroom.
It is better than I expected!
I am glad I bought it.
As for the light, you can adjust its brightness and color by touch.
The white color goes well with any room, and the color light changes with the gradation, so it's beautiful.
Also, if you touch a color you like, it will stop at your favorite color, so you can make it glow according to your mood!
Since it is LED type, a long life can be expected.
As for the sound quality, I think it's more than satisfactory enough for my amateur ears.
Also, the great thing about this light is that it's multifunctional.
A large speaker is attached to the top.
Bluetooth pairing with mobile phones and other devices is possible, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.
When paired with a mobile phone, hands-free calling is also possible.
In addition, since it also supports MicroSD, it can be linked to a computer and play music as an mp3 player.
Typing and piano practice
At the age of 66, he started trying DTM to prevent blur.
I bought an audio interface and the unit.
At first, I was typing, but I became addicted to playing the piano, and I spend all my time practicing every day.
I downloaded the attached sound source, but the protection didn't work, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but I use this for piano practice because the free piano sound source sounds good.
I am glad I bought it.
There is a feeling of being deceived by the appearance.
Is it a hit or miss product?
It will be a long post.
The synthetic leather of the Doshisha office chair (jump-up armrest) that I used for 4-5 years has deteriorated and become worn out, so I'm considering buying a non-synthetic leather chair with a jump-up armrest.
I searched hardware stores and furniture stores, but there was nothing suitable.
I'm worried that I won't be able to check the actual item, but I compromised on the look of the design and the price and bought this item on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is one spare screw.
[caution] The included hex wrench and screws are greasy.
At first, I couldn't see the oil sticking to the hex wrench, and the body was white, so I was impatient when the oil came on.
Assembly completed in 40 minutes.
Completed and product confirmed.
The flip-up armrests are different in the hardness of raising and lowering on the left and right, the left is heavy for raising and lowering, the right is light, and the armrest is not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak and hangs down immediately with a "click."
The seat is made of non-regenerative high-density urethane foam, which feels hard and is not comfortable to sit on (weak elasticity?
The competition mesh on the backrest is harder than other companies' mesh chairs, and if you wear it lightly, your back hurts.
It's a small detail, but the height from the seat to the ground was 530, not 550 (seat height is important for tall people), and the legs that support the casters are not made of steel, so there are doubts about durability.
I use a cushion that I bought separately, and the mesh fabric part is covered with a towel because it deteriorates (damages) quickly.
At 186cm and 80kg, I felt that only the fit on the back was good, but other than that, I think it's a low-satisfaction product, and I also feel that it's a hit and miss product.
After all, it may be better to buy an office chair by sitting and looking at the actual product.
I received an Amazon email from the manufacturer with a purchase greeting, should I contact them about the armrest and headrest?
It is under consideration.
Well, is it like this?
I bought a PIXELA 4K tuner because I thought I would be able to see BS4K turning right in my home environment, so I didn't expect much and the price was cheap.
As an experiment, I was able to watch NHK BS4K and other free right-turn broadcasts, and I was able to watch them beautifully on a Panasonic 4K TV that I bought at the same time.
(sometimes the images get choppy) The update came soon after I bought it, and now that it supports recording, I have some scheduled recordings to watch, but I wonder if the external 2.5-inch HDD is affected, or if only the image stops playing or skips frames.
The user interface has not been praised, either, and we have simply stated that "you can watch 4K broadcasts."
By the way, during scheduled recording, it feels like you can only follow and play the recorded program, and I accept this as a positive feature that you can record in 4K on the HDD.
If you buy with a lot of expectations you may be disappointed, so don't expect too much.
I hope this will improve with the update.
Heat retention function OK
I've only used the heat retention function yet, but when I put in two 500ml plastic bottles, it got warm in about 2 hours and felt hot in 2.5 hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of a compact car and used it, but the fan noise is annoying when idling stops, but I don't feel it at all while driving.
Perhaps because it was still new, I was worried about the smell of chemicals emitted by the fan, so I had to open the windows regularly to ventilate.
As another person wrote in a review, the burrs on the part where the shoulder strap goes through are terrible, so you need to break the burrs with a flathead screwdriver.
It's really fragile
Today, two months after I started using it, it suddenly broke.
I liked the feel and size of the keys, but it's meaningless if they break.
I use my computer all day for video editing, and the volume goes to 100% on its own.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.
I can't use the earphones because they hurt my ears, and the volume is so loud that I don't even want to use the computer at night.
It seems to send a signal every few seconds, and the volume display repeatedly appears and disappears on the computer screen.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with the mouse's instructions, so you can't use the mouse freely unless you turn the keyboard off every time.
The Enter and Backspace keys also no longer respond.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it's around 1,000 yen, you might want to try it out.
If you are lucky, you can use it for about six months.
This is a six-month warranty compared to the one- to three-year warranty offered by other companies in the same price range.
The short warranty period speaks volumes about its fragility.
Product is great, packaging is terrible
I love the different colors of these products.
I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a food stocker!!
However, there was a gap in the large cardboard so that it could roll around, and there was no delivery note, so the packaging was horrible.
When I opened the box, the lid was off.
I would recommend the product, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about the strength, but for now
When I bought a new lid, I bought it because I no longer felt comfortable with the support.
It plays a role in stabilizing the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, it will make a nasty sound like "It's about to break..."
You have to choose the one that matches the thickness of the lid, so be careful when buying.
Cute bag with a meat ball
I have a dog and when I was looking for a bag to go out with, I was attracted to the stylish gray bag and bought this one.
It was built upright, and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so it didn't feel so heavy to hold.
The zipper also moves smoothly and there is no snagging.
It seems to be easy even for long travel.
It is very compact and easy to fold.
Even when folded, you can see the design of the meatball, and it's cute when placed.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use
First of all, I fell in love at first sight with the appearance and the low price!
The TSA lock has been my favorite for a few years now, and I have several others that are useful.
And for those who are experts at forgetting or losing their keys, a number lock is recommended.
However, to be honest, I put the most important point on lightness, so it's okay, but if you want durability and security, the zipper part will last a week, and since it's cloth, it will snap with a knife! if it's cut, it will break in an instant.
Also, the way the zippers fit together is sweet, so I'd like to see some ingenuity in overlapping them.
It is recommended for carry-on if you are overseas.
For the time being, I used it on a Shinkansen trip and it was comfortable.
It's difficult to choose a size...
I have a hard time buying shoes because they are so wide.
I wear 24cm Converse and Vans
MRL996 is also 24cm.
At first I thought it was tough, but once I got used to it, I was fine.
My sister said that 24.5cm was too tight for this ML574, so when I was allowed to wear it, it was definitely tough.
It felt like my little finger was hitting it.
So I bought a 25cm.
When I arrived and opened it, it was big...
When I tried them on, they were a little loose even when I was wearing socks.
I was wondering if I should return it, but if I go for a 24.5 and it gets tight, it'll be a hassle, so I'm going to wear a 25 with the insole on.
I bought team red and it's bright red and very good!
There are a lot of monotone black and white outfits, so wearing this will brighten you up!
165cm, male in his 40s
I ordered a random L size, but if your specs are similar to the ones below, I recommend the M size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel circumference: 100 cm This is a typical metabolic belly.
< Usage > In the water, the rash guard will roll up, probably because the waist is loose.
I'm swimming while fixing the curled part.
Especially if you are careless in the jacuzzi, your metabolic syndrome will be fully visible.
Also, if you walk while doing intense up and down movements, it will still come up from below.
[product construction] The fabric is durable and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about your nipples showing through.
At this price, I am satisfied with this construction, but I think it will fit better if you buy a smaller version.
There was a gas leak, after all...
The Silver Colt 25 still had a gas leak, there was a problem where part of the tank was missing when replacing the valve, but when I used [Bass Bond Q] to seal the tank and grease it for repair, I was able to hit it smoothly. if you want to buy this Colt 25, ask someone who can disassemble and assemble it, or someone who is not confident because they don't disassemble while taking pictures with a digital camera, I don't recommend it much, but it might be fun for people who are willing to break it down.
I was wondering what kind of quality 188 yen was
It can be used either for fast turning or when torque is required.
It's light, small, and above all, it's simple without embellishments.
There was no rattling when the bit was attached, and I thought it was an amazing value for money for 188 yen.
Another issue is durability.
It may not be used that often, but I think it's a good thing to have in your toolbox.
I bought it together with the 1 / 4 "Hex Shank Magnetic Quick Release Screwdriver Knurled Bit Holder 60 / 100 / 150mm from the same seller.
There was no problem here, or rather, it was pretty good for the price.
The controller is stuck
The aircraft moves on its own and cannot be controlled.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, it quickly moves in the wrong direction and becomes impossible to operate.
It is better not to buy this product.
I want to warn you.
This is a terrible product.
It's wired, but I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It's reliable and hasn't broken even after a long time of use.
It can also be used for PC games.
P.S. I was able to get a refund on my Amazon gift certificate if I returned it as a defective item within a month, so I'm glad about that.
Will this improve my calculation power?
I think it's suitable for children who understand calculation.
Isn't it impossible unless the child has some understanding of calculation?
It is hard to understand the problem.
Also, when giving tools to the master, I slide my finger up on the screen, but I tried it myself, but it doesn't go smoothly no matter how many times I do it.
In short, it may be easier for people who are used to DS to slide it on.
I don't like the illustrations of manga characters either, or rather, I think DS and other games start out with the fun of the screen, but for some reason I don't feel familiar with them.
The method of calculation is also like a race against time, for example, how many questions can be answered correctly in a certain number of minutes.
I understand how it feels to rush something like an exam... but doesn't it make you hurry up and calculate?
For some reason I don't like the sound of the gong when it's over.
Even though you're working hard, wouldn't it be nice to make it sound more comfortable?
I feel like I lost 6,200 yen with this.
I can understand if it's half the price.
I'm sorry, I ended up with ☆ 2 for this reason.
I really like Persona's songs!
Persona 3 reaches ED.
I played 5 part way through.
Persona 4 has already been upgraded on vita.
What I can do hasn't changed since the previous Persona 4.
Because there is no story, it feels shorter than the previous work.
The song is really cool!
Just listening to it makes me feel better!
The characters in Persona 3 were released in HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I first saw them.
Somehow Junpei looked handsome (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so it's not fresh... If you think about it, I feel 3 is a better deal.
As for sound games, I felt 5 was easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see when the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it's easy to see even when it overlaps with the background.
There are plenty of assist functions, so I think even people who aren't good at sound games can play it.
If you're an expert in sound games, turning on the challenge feature may make the game more challenging.
The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not just an extra, it's a solid 4-disc set, so if you like Persona songs, I recommend this.
It's a shame.
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the picture, but the actual color is bluish but closer to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but it's on hold for now. will I give up because of the low price?
P.S. After the review was posted, I received an email from the seller apologizing and saying they would exchange it for a new item.
The subsequent processing was also quick.
I think the response was very good even though the product was cheap.
4 stars for support Postscript After that I also bought gold.
I think the color is almost exactly as shown in the picture and very beautiful.
However, the buckle is not double locked, and the difference from the illustration is obvious.
That's the only disappointment.
It gets really heavy in the evening.
I used it on my SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the initial setup, I didn't know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to teach me (go to Settings > Mobile Communications > Communication Options and turn on data roaming), and it worked.
The manual attached to the product didn't seem to have much to do with it...?
However, the signal around Gimpo Airport was in poor condition, so I was holding on to 3G all the time.
When it went out into the city, it became 4G
At times in the evenings and nights, the connection was very heavy, but now that I think about it, I might have reached the maximum limit of hundreds of MB a day.
Better than i thought
After using SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, making it sim free and using it with Ymobile, the Z4 started to go bad, so I was looking for a used Xperia, and I found and purchased this phone that was brand new and could use my old mobile phone.
I was using a mobile Suica, so I was worried if I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
Since I bought the size, weight and silver, I get the impression that it's an iPhone 6?
I don't play games, so the processing speed is the same as the Z4, and I have the impression that it's a little faster. in the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition is slow, but I have the impression that it takes a while to recognize it, so facial recognition is faster, so I use it here.
I thought it was amazing that it was like an iPhone. I also switched to Android version 9, and I was able to make a satisfactory purchase.
Things I'm worried about It could be a little smaller No strap holes * Compatible with cases with strap holes I haven't experimented with water resistance It's a little heavy I've only used it a little but I'm satisfied I recommend it
